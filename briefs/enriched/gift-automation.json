  "topic": "Automating gift-giving for birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and thank-you occasions so the client spends under 30 seconds per gift decision. The core problem: busy executives forget important dates, scramble last-minute for generic gifts, and feel guilty about dropped balls in relationships that matter. The solution: a proactive system where the EA monitors upcoming occasions, researches personalized gift options based on recipient preferences and history, presents curated choices, handles ordering and shipping, and tracks thank-you responses. Key workflows: one-time database setup with People/Gifts/Events tables, EA backfill from email receipts to populate gift history, recurring approval flow where EA presents 5 options and client replies with number 1-5, thank-you tracking to log reactions and improve future recommendations. Edge cases: international shipping requiring 6+ weeks lead time, corporate compliance limits on gift values, last-minute additions when client meets someone new. Success means: never missing an important date, receiving 'how did you know?' reactions from recipients, reclaiming 10+ hours per year previously spent on gift stress, and eliminating gift-related guilt entirely.",
