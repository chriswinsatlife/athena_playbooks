  Automating gift-giving for birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and thank-you occasions
  so the client never misses an important date or sends a generic gift again.

  This playbook covers the complete system: building a gift database of recipients with
  preferences, budgets, and important dates; setting up proactive reminders; using the
  "reply with a number" paradigm where the EA researches and presents 3-5 curated options;
  handling procurement, wrapping, and delivery logistics; and tracking gift history to
  avoid repeats.

  The system should handle recurring occasions (birthdays, holidays) and one-off events
  (thank you gifts, congratulations, sympathy). It should scale from 10 recipients to 100+
  without proportionally increasing client time investment.

  Edge cases include: last-minute gifts (24-48 hour turnaround), international shipping,
  corporate gift policies and limits, dietary restrictions for food gifts, and handling
  returns or exchanges.

persona:
  archetype: "Time-starved founder with 50+ important relationships to maintain"
  pain_points:
    - Forgets birthdays until the day-of, scrambles for Amazon gift cards
    - Sends generic gifts that don't reflect the relationship
    - Spends 2+ hours per gift researching and ordering
    - Has no memory of what was sent previously, risks repeats
  goals:
    - Never miss an important date
    - Send thoughtful, personalized gifts that strengthen relationships
    - Reduce per-gift time investment to under 30 seconds (pick a number)
    - Build reputation as someone who "always remembers"

research_guidance:
  must_cover:
    - Gift database setup (Airtable/Notion template)
    - Reply-with-number workflow for gift selection
    - Proactive reminder system (2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days before)
    - Procurement and fulfillment delegation
    - Gift history tracking to prevent repeats
  do_not_cover:
    - Specific gift recommendations or product reviews
    - DIY gift-making
    - Gift wrapping tutorials
  depth_guidance: "Practitioner depth - specific enough to implement immediately"
  angles:
    - Delegation-first (what client does vs what EA handles)
    - Relationship ROI (gifts as relationship investment)
    - Scale without stress (system handles 10 or 100 recipients)

section_hints:
  - The gift database (what to track, how to structure)
  - Setting up the reminder system
  - The reply-with-number gift selection workflow
  - Delegation handoff (what the EA needs to execute)
  - Handling edge cases (rush orders, international, corporate limits)

delegation_focus: |
  This is a vicarious-offensive delegation: the EA proactively surfaces opportunities
  and presents curated options. The client's only job is to pick a number.
  
  The EA handles: research, curation, procurement, tracking, reminders.
  The client handles: initial preferences, final selection (30 seconds), personal notes.
