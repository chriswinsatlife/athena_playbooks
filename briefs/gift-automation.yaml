  Automating gift-giving for birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and thank-you occasions
  so the client spends under 30 seconds per gift while giving more thoughtful presents.

  This playbook covers the full lifecycle: initial setup of a gift tracking database,
  populating historical gift data from email receipts, establishing reminder cadences
  (default 30 days before events), the EA's gift research and curation workflow,
  the client's simple approval process (reply with a number 1-5), order fulfillment,
  and tracking thank-you notes received.

  Key workflows to detail:
  - One-time setup: client adds important people with birthdays/anniversaries
  - EA backfill: mining email for past gift purchases to avoid repeats
  - Recurring flow: EA sends curated options, client picks, EA orders
  - Edge cases: international shipping (6+ week lead time), custom/personalized items,
    corporate gifts with compliance requirements, group gifts, registry purchases

  The playbook should emphasize that this is "vicarious-offensive" delegation: the EA
  proactively surfaces opportunities and handles execution, not just reactive task completion.
  Success looks like: client gets excited thank-you texts, never misses an important date,
  relationships strengthen, and total time investment drops from 10+ hours/year to under 1.

persona:
  archetype: Time-starved founder or executive who values relationships but chronically forgets dates
  pain_points:
    - Forgets birthdays until day-of, scrambles for last-minute gifts
    - Gives generic gifts because no time to research
    - Feels guilty about dropped balls on important relationships
    - Partner or spouse frustrated about forgotten anniversaries
  goals:
    - Never miss an important date
    - Give gifts that show genuine thought
    - Strengthen personal and professional relationships
    - Reclaim hours spent on gift logistics

source_material: |
  From existing Coda playbook:
  - Clients use Airtable with tabs: People, Gifts, Gift Events, Sources, Brands
  - EA creates calendar reminders 30 days before each event
  - Gift value ranges: $25-50 (acquaintances), $50-150 (close friends/family), $150+ (VIPs)
  - Success metric: "30 seconds per gift" - client just replies with a number
  - Sources tab contains curated retailers by category
  - Brands tab tracks recipient preferences

section_hints:
  - What elite gift-giving looks like, the end state vision with a WhatsApp mockup
  - One-time client setup, 10 minutes checklist format
  - EA onboarding to the system
  - Historical data population, EA workflow
  - The recurring gift workflow, the core loop
  - Handling special cases like international, corporate, custom, registries
  - Measuring success and iterating on the system

delegation_focus: |
  Emphasize the transition from reactive to proactive: the EA doesn't wait to be asked,
  they monitor the calendar and surface opportunities. The client's only job is to
  approve one of the curated options. This is the "reply with a number" paradigm -
  the pinnacle of vicarious-offensive delegation where the EA anticipates needs.
