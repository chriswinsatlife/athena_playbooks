# Gift automation

This playbook turns gifting into a system: capture context, pick from a small set of rules, execute reliably, and keep a light feedback loop.

## What this covers

- Occasions and triggers
- Constraints (budget, taste, shipping windows)
- Execution workflow

## Workflow

## Core constraints

- Default budget bands are set per relationship tier.
- No gifts that create recipient burden (set up, subscriptions, returns) unless explicitly requested.
- Escalate if the gift could be read as high-signal (romance, religion, politics).
