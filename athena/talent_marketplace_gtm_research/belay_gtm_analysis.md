# BELAY Go-To-Market & Marketing Channel Strategy Report

## Positioning & Ideal Customers (ICP)  
BELAY positions itself as a premium virtual staffing solution for busy leaders – from executives and SMB owners to entrepreneurs. The core message is **“You shouldn’t have to do everything. And now you don’t have to.”** This speaks directly to overwhelmed professionals who lack time for high-value work. BELAY highlights common pain points (overflowing inboxes, missed opportunities, chaotic routines) and frames a **Virtual Assistant as a strategic partner**, not just a task-doer ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=What%20you%20need%20is%20a,focus%20on%20what%20matters%20most)). By emphasizing that their U.S.-based assistants are rigorously vetted (with an acceptance rate *“lower than Harvard’s”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=What%20you%20need%20is%20a,focus%20on%20what%20matters%20most))), BELAY builds confidence that clients get top talent they can trust. The tagline **“The Right Hire. Right Now.”** encapsulates their value – providing immediate, qualified help so leaders can focus on what matters. This positioning appeals to clients who want to **“delegate to elevate”** their business and reclaim work-life balance. In fact, BELAY’s story grew from its founders’ own need for a *“third option”* – a way to pursue an ambitious career while being present for family ([www.tylerdickerhoof.com](https://www.tylerdickerhoof.com/podcast/5jzfwaympmpt2j8-3wtsp-7t8wa-bwh6z-6x5d4-jg46c-cbbf4-6e67g#:~:text=BELAY%20CEO%20Tricia%20Sciortino%20runs,careers%20and%20present%20family%20lives)). BELAY leans into being a solution for exactly that kind of busy professional. Key elements of their positioning include: 

- **Pain-Focused Messaging:** BELAY’s marketing identifies with leaders feeling like *“superheroes”* trying to do it all, and then offers relief. For example, they ask *“Feel like you can’t take a vacation?”* or *“How many opportunities are you missing because of chaos?”* to resonate with stressed entrepreneurs ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Where%20are%20you%20coming%20up,short)). By validating these struggles, BELAY creates urgency for a solution.  

- **Strategic Partner vs. Assistant:** Instead of positioning assistants as mere task executors, BELAY calls them *“a partner who steps into your world…so you can step up where it matters.”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Assistant%20Solutions%20BELAY%20Assistants%20don%E2%80%99t,Strategic%20Partner%E2%9E%9C%20%20%201)) This language elevates the role to an executive-level support, aligning with the ego and needs of high-achieving clients.  

- **Quality & Trust Differentiator:** BELAY heavily underscores the caliber of its talent. Citing a Harvard-low acceptance rate and a bench of thousands of U.S.-based specialists ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%203)), they reassure clients that **only the best** become BELAY assistants. This differentiator (quality over quantity) is a tactic any talent marketplace can use to signal value.  

- **Focus on Outcomes:** The promise isn’t just an assistant – it’s *“more time to focus on what matters most”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=virtual%20assistant%20goes%20through%20a,focus%20on%20what%20matters%20most)). BELAY sells an outcome (business growth, personal freedom) rather than a service, which is powerful positioning. They explicitly tie having the right remote assistant to achieving new heights in the organization ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=What%20you%20need%20is%20a,focus%20on%20what%20matters%20most)). This aspirational angle inspires prospects by painting a picture of life *after* delegating.  

BELAY’s clear focus on **overworked leaders seeking relief** guides all their marketing. By addressing this ICP’s pain and hopes so directly, BELAY’s positioning creates a strong emotional connection (“finally, a solution for me!”) and sets the stage for their trust-building efforts that follow.

## Brand Trust & Proof Points  
BELAY has deliberately built a trusted brand in the virtual staffing industry, using numerous social proofs and assurances to win confidence: 

- **Awards & Accolades:** BELAY has been recognized repeatedly on the national stage. They boast **10 consecutive years on the Inc. 5000** list of fastest-growing companies ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/belay-recognized-as-a-2025-inc-power-partner-award-winner#:~:text=This%20marks%20BELAY%27s%20first%20year,growing%20private%20companies%20in%20America)) and in 2025 were named an **Inc. “Power Partner”** for their role in helping other businesses grow ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/belay-recognized-as-a-2025-inc-power-partner-award-winner#:~:text=ATLANTA%2C%20November%205%2C%202025%20%28Newswire,entrepreneurs%20and%20helping%20companies%20grow)). They also earned an **Inc. Best in Business** award for going beyond profitability to make a positive impact, underscoring integrity in how they operate. Such honors send a signal to prospects that BELAY is reputable and successful.  

- **Culture & Values Recognition:** Despite being a 100% remote company for over a decade, BELAY has won *“major culture and business awards from prominent national magazines”* ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20has%20since%20paid,plus%20remote%20workforce%20team)). This includes accolades as a top workplace, which BELAY proudly highlights to demonstrate that their team (and thus the service) is stable and well-run. They attribute this success to living out core values of *“gratitude, teamwork, vision, passion, fun, and God”* in their 1,100+ member remote workforce ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=awards%20from%20prominent%20national%20magazines,plus%20remote%20workforce%20team%20members)). By highlighting a values-driven culture, BELAY appeals to clients who seek a principled, reliable partner (and it differentiates them from faceless gig platforms).  

- **Client Testimonials & Case Studies:** BELAY makes heavy use of client success stories, testimonials, and reviews to let happy customers speak for them. Their blog features dozens of **Client Success Story** articles across industries. For example, in one case study a CEO describes how *“BELAY took over the entire hiring and vetting process”* for her, demonstrating the ease and trust she gained ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/case-study-jasmine-womack#:~:text=The%20Solution)). These real-life examples (often naming the client’s business and results) provide relatable proof that BELAY delivers. BELAY also cites high-profile endorsements – e.g. author Michael Hyatt, a respected leadership expert, is a *“glowing”* fan ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=members)). Such endorsements and Fortune 500 client shout-outs ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=members)) lend third-party credibility.  

- **“Brands Who Trust Us” Logos:** On the website, BELAY showcases a banner of well-known company logos (under *“Brands Who Trust Us”*) to create instant trust through association. Seeing familiar brand names that use BELAY acts as implicit validation for new visitors. This tactic of leveraging marquee clients is common in B2B and helps position BELAY as the go-to provider for even large, discerning organizations.  

- **The BELAY Guarantee:** To remove adoption risk, BELAY offers a clear guarantee around their service. They promise that **“your match sticks”**, meaning if an assistant isn’t the right fit, they will rematch the client until it’s right ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Management%20Burden%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong%20hire)). This *BELAY Guarantee* assures prospects they won’t be “locked into the wrong hire,” addressing a major fear in delegating work to someone new. By publicly stating this guarantee, BELAY lowers the barrier for hesitant customers – a best practice for building trust.  

- **Comparison Transparency:** BELAY’s site directly compares hiring an assistant through BELAY vs. doing it yourself, highlighting advantages line by line. For instance, BELAY notes a **match can be found in as little as one week** (versus 4–8+ weeks hiring solo), with a **flat monthly fee** (versus salary, benefits, and overhead of an employee) ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Speed%20to%20Hire%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong)). They even emphasize that each client gets a dedicated **Client Success Consultant** for support, whereas on your own “you manage everything” ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Overhead%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong)). By openly acknowledging common concerns (speed, cost, management effort) and showing BELAY’s edge, they come across as confident and transparent. This comparative approach builds trust that BELAY understands client worries and can mitigate them.  

All these proof points work together to convey that **BELAY is a safe, proven choice**. The company’s longevity (founded 2010), large client base, and numerous awards paint it as an industry leader. Meanwhile, guarantees, case studies, and third-party endorsements address both the rational and emotional doubts a potential customer might have. For a global talent marketplace, BELAY’s strategy underlines the importance of investing in credibility – through consistent excellence and then broadcasting those wins – to earn the trust of both clients and talent.

## Website Conversion Strategy  
BELAY’s website is optimized to capture interested visitors and convert them into sales consultations. Rather than offering instant sign-up or pricing online, the site drives users toward a **personalized consultation funnel**, reflecting their high-touch sales approach. Key tactics include:

- **Clear Calls-to-Action:** Throughout the site, BELAY employs prominent CTAs like **“Hire BELAY”** or **“Get Started”** that lead to their lead-capture form ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Hire%20BELAY)). The navigation and page layouts consistently steer prospects to this action, ensuring that no matter what content a visitor browses (assistant services, bookkeeping, etc.), the next step to engage is obvious. The language “Get Started – the easiest thing you’ll do today” is inviting and lowers perceived effort to reach out.  

- **Multi-Step Lead Form & Qualification:** The **“Get Started”** form itself is designed to qualify leads in a friendly way. It first asks basic contact info and company name, then on the next step asks **“What service are you most interested in? (Virtual Assistants, Accounting Services, Marketing Assistant)”** as well as **“How did you hear about us?”** ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Almost%20done)). By capturing the prospect’s primary need, BELAY can route the inquiry to the appropriate specialist (e.g. someone versed in bookkeeping vs. admin support). The *“how did you hear”* dropdown – which includes options like *Podcast ads, Dave Ramsey, Michael Hyatt, Referral, Online Search,* etc. ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=What%20service%20are%20you%20most,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)) – shows BELAY’s focus on tracking marketing attribution for each lead. This data helps them double down on channels that convert (a smart feedback loop for their GTM strategy). Upon submission, a message assures the prospect that **“One of our Solutions Consultants will be in touch shortly,”** setting the expectation of personal follow-up ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Thank%20you%20for%20your%20submission,will%20be%20in%20touch%20shortly)).  

- **Consultative Offer (Not Self-Service):** The site emphasizes scheduling a **free consultation and personalized price quote** rather than listing rigid packages or prices upfront ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=free%20consultation%20and%20personalized%20price,quote)). This consultative call is framed as an opportunity to *“identify your exact needs and pain points to determine if we are a fit”* ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/get-started-belay#:~:text=)). By doing this, BELAY increases conversion by reducing sticker shock (no prices to prematurely turn people away) and by creating a human-to-human sales opportunity where value can be conveyed before price. It effectively moves the decision from the website to a phone call, where their sales team can shine.  

- **Educational Lead Magnets:** BELAY’s site also offers valuable resources (e.g. a *“Delegate to Elevate”* eBook ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/blog/one-next-step-085-how-to-delegate-effectively-matt-seaton/#:~:text=This%20week%E2%80%99s%20resource%20is%20BELAY%E2%80%99s,accomplish%20more%20by%20juggling%20less)), guides, checklists) in exchange for contact info. These act as softer conversion points for visitors not ready to “talk to sales.” For instance, the homepage promotes a delegation eBook (“This eBook tells you how” to delegate) ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Delegate%20to%20Elevate)). Downloading such content likely triggers an email nurture sequence or follow-up by the team. This strategy captures top-of-funnel prospects and nurtures them until they might be ready for the consultation.  

- **Addressing Objections On-Page:** BELAY’s web content works to preemptively answer questions that prospects have. As noted, a comparison chart outlines BELAY vs. a DIY hire on critical factors (speed, cost, risk) ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Speed%20to%20Hire%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong%20hire)). Elsewhere, service pages include **FAQs** (e.g. *“Do I need to clean up my books before I start?”* with “No, your BELAY Bookkeeper can help as part of onboarding” answer) ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/services/bookkeeping/#:~:text=,needs%20grow%3F%20Yes%2C%20you%20can)). By handling these queries on the site, BELAY eases concerns and builds confidence, which in turn improves conversion rates. A visitor who sees their question answered is more likely to fill out the form.  

- **Minimal Friction & Clear Next Steps:** BELAY’s form is short and doesn’t ask for excessive information – just enough to start the conversation. They also include a consent checkbox for marketing messages, but make it clear it’s *“not a condition of purchase”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Organization%20Name)), reducing fear of spam. After submission, the confirmation reinforces that a human will reach out, giving a personal touch even in the web experience. Overall, the path from landing on the site to becoming a lead is straightforward and comforting. 

**Conversion Example:** A visitor searching “outsourced executive assistant” lands on BELAY’s site and sees client testimonials and a *“Find Your Strategic Partner ➜”* button right away ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Assistant%20Solutions%20BELAY%20Assistants%20don%E2%80%99t,Strategic%20Partner%E2%9E%9C%20%20%201)). Scrolling, they encounter the *“Here’s How It Works”* step-by-step, which transparently explains the process from initial call to onboarding ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%201)) ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%205)) – this likely overcomes hesitation. Finally, the visitor clicks **“Get Started”**, selects *“Virtual Assistants”*, and notes they heard about BELAY on the *EntreLeadership podcast* (one of the form options). They submit the form, feeling reassured by the site’s content that BELAY understands their pain and has a plan to solve it. This smooth funnel is a testament to BELAY’s effective website conversion strategy. Other talent marketplaces can learn from this: **make it easy to start, educate as you capture, and get prospects into a personal conversation quickly.**

## Content Marketing (Blog, Resources, Podcasts, Books)  
BELAY has developed a rich content engine to attract, educate, and nurture its audience. Their content marketing is multi-faceted, establishing BELAY as both an industry thought leader and a helpful mentor to potential clients. Major components include:

- **Prolific Blog with Value-Add Insights:** BELAY runs an active blog (“How To’s & Tips on Leadership & Remote Working”) targeting topics their audience cares about – productivity, delegation, remote team management, finance for small business, etc. The blog is updated frequently (multiple posts per month) and organized by categories like *Small Business*, *Leadership*, *Virtual Assistants*, *Financial*, *Church*, etc. Many posts directly address questions or pain points the ICP has. For example, articles like **“How to Know It’s Time to Start Delegating”**, **“How Do I Hire My First Virtual Assistant?”**, and **“Why Your First Hire Should Be a VA”** are part of an in-depth *Ultimate Guide* series ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=1,Help%20Me%20Manage%20My%20Time)). This series walks readers step-by-step from recognizing the problem (being overwhelmed) to implementing the solution (working effectively with a VA). By offering such comprehensive guides for free, BELAY not only boosts SEO (more on that later) but also builds trust – readers get a taste of BELAY’s expertise before ever becoming clients. The tone of the content is practical and empathetic, often with real examples or expert quotes, so that readers genuinely learn something actionable. This kind of valuable content turns BELAY’s site into a resource library that draws in prospects organically and keeps them engaged.  

- **Lead Magnets & Downloadable Guides:** In addition to blog posts, BELAY produces premium content pieces – eBooks, whitepapers, checklists – which typically require filling out a form to download. One flagship example is the **“Delegate to Elevate” eBook** ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/blog/one-next-step-085-how-to-delegate-effectively-matt-seaton/#:~:text=This%20week%E2%80%99s%20resource%20is%20BELAY%E2%80%99s,accomplish%20more%20by%20juggling%20less)), which promises to help leaders *“accomplish more by juggling less.”* They also have guides like *“The Only Onboarding Guide You’ll Ever Need”* (for bringing on a virtual team member) and *“Lead Anyone From Anywhere: Culture”* – indicating content even on building remote culture ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/tag/ebooks-guides#:~:text=Class%20Dismissed%3A%20The%20Only%20Onboarding,Guide%20You%27ll%20Ever%20Need)). These in-depth resources serve as ice-breakers for new leads; someone may find BELAY through a Google search, download a delegation checklist, and then enter BELAY’s email nurturing funnel. BELAY can then follow up with tips, case studies, and gentle prompts to consider hiring an assistant. This strategy nurtures prospects over time and positions BELAY as a helpful advisor rather than just a service provider.  

- **“One Next Step” Podcast:** BELAY launched *One Next Step*, branded as *“the most practical business podcast in the world”*, to extend their thought leadership via audio. Hosted by BELAY’s CEO and VP, the weekly podcast invites guests to discuss topics relevant to small business leadership, productivity, and growth. Notably, episodes often feature **BELAY clients and their assistants** sharing their success stories. For instance, Episode 129 has BELAY client Geoff Welch and his VA Trúc Towns discussing how they learned to work together and offering tips for getting started with a VA ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/podcast/#:~:text=0%20129%3A%20Geoff%20Welch%20,his%20strengths%20in%20both%20his)). By spotlighting actual client-VA pairings, the podcast content doubles as testimonial and educational material (listeners hear firsthand the benefits and how to make it work). Other episodes include interviews with business authors and experts, ensuring fresh perspectives. Each episode is paired with a downloadable *“Activation Guide”* (e.g. a summary or worksheet) – another clever lead magnet approach. The podcast not only draws in an audience via podcast directories but also provides a trove of content to repurpose (blog summaries, quote graphics for social media, etc.). It solidifies BELAY’s brand as an authority on delegation and remote work.  

- **Published Books & Thought Leadership:** BELAY’s leadership has literally written the book on their domain. Co-founder Bryan Miles authored **“Virtual Culture: The Way We Work Doesn’t Work Anymore”**, a manifesto on building effective remote teams. Co-founder Shannon Miles wrote **“The Third Option”**, about balancing career and family, echoing BELAY’s work-life integration ethos. These books were not just passion projects – they serve as marketing assets that raise BELAY’s profile (often leading to media coverage and speaking engagements). BELAY leverages the credibility from these books in marketing; for example, citing ideas from *Virtual Culture* in blog posts about remote team management, or Shannon’s story from *The Third Option* in webinars aimed at working parents. This form of content – long-form and published – is a **long-term brand builder**. It associates BELAY with expertise and visionary thinking in the flexible work space. Similarly, BELAY’s internal experts frequently contribute guest articles (e.g. CEO Tricia Sciortino wrote for magazines like Entrepreneur and has been featured in Forbes) which further amplifies their thought leadership content beyond their own channels.  

- **Webinars, Courses and Events:** BELAY also hosts live or on-demand **webinars** to engage their community and leads. Topics tend to align with their content themes – e.g. *“5 Ways to Delegate Today”* or *“How to Prepare for Year-End Financials”* – offering actionable tips and a Q&A portion. These webinars often feature a BELAY leader or a happy client as co-presenter, subtly marketing the service while primarily delivering value. In one innovative collaboration, BELAY partnered with *The Assist* (a popular newsletter for assistants) to run an **“Ultimate Virtual Assistant Masterclass”**, tapping into their contractor community. Furthermore, BELAY has rolled out **online courses** on their site, like *“Managing Remote Teams”* or a mini-course on Inbox Management priced at $19.99 ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/courses/#:~:text=Courses%20,Includes%3A)). Selling courses is not a core revenue stream, but it’s a strategic content play – it monetizes knowledge for a wider audience and cements BELAY’s reputation as experts (people buying a course about remote teams may eventually decide to hire BELAY for help). Lastly, BELAY appears at industry events and conferences (often as sponsors or speakers) to share insights. For example, BELAY’s CEO spoke on the Leadercast podcast about engaging remote teams, and BELAY frequently sponsors leadership conferences (such as EntreLeadership Summit or faith-based leadership events) where they can reach their target market in person.  

**Content Example:** To see BELAY’s content marketing in action – consider their blog post *“What’s the Difference Between a Human Virtual Assistant and an AI Assistant?”* ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/all#:~:text=Learn%20the%20key%20differences%20between,for%20productivity%20and%20executive%20support)). This timely article educates readers on when a human VA is more effective than AI and vice versa, indirectly reinforcing the value of BELAY’s human-centric service. The post likely draws organic traffic due to the hot topic of AI. Within the content, BELAY can position its services (e.g. emphasizing that **“you need a real person who knows your business and can fix issues fast”** – a subtle nod to their model ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/belay-faq-can-i-outsource-my-bookkeeping-without-giving-up-control#:~:text=Summary))). The article then ends with a call-to-action to download a related resource or speak with BELAY, smoothly moving the reader from learning to considering their service. This exemplifies how BELAY’s content funnel works: attract with valuable content, prove expertise, then invite engagement. For global talent marketplaces, BELAY’s content strategy shows the importance of going beyond just promoting services – by genuinely educating your audience and providing resources, you nurture trust and stay top-of-mind until prospects are ready to convert.

## SEO & Organic Acquisition  
BELAY’s strong content efforts feed directly into an effective SEO strategy. By creating content around the keywords and questions their ideal clients are searching, BELAY captures significant organic traffic. Key aspects of their SEO and organic approach include: 

- **Targeted Keyword Clusters:** BELAY produces content to rank for search terms related to their services and the problems those services solve. For example, they target **“virtual assistant”** queries with expansive guides (their *“Ultimate Guide to Working With a Virtual Assistant”* is a pillar page covering everything from why to hire, how to hire, to how to work with a VA ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=1,Help%20Me%20Manage%20My%20Time))). This guide is structured with headings that match common search queries – effectively capturing people at various stages of the hiring journey. Similarly, for **bookkeeping** they publish niche content like “Can I outsource my bookkeeping without giving up control?” – an exact question a business owner might Google. The answer posted on their site affirms outsourcing can work *“if you choose a partner that keeps you in the loop and supports you with real people – not just software”* ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/belay-faq-can-i-outsource-my-bookkeeping-without-giving-up-control#:~:text=Summary)), which both answers the query and pitches BELAY’s value prop. By clustering content (guides, FAQs, blog posts) around themes like *virtual assistants, remote executive assistants, outsourced bookkeeping, fractional CFO services, social media management,* etc., BELAY casts a wide net in search rankings. Each blog post or FAQ is an entry point that can funnel into their main service pages or lead magnets.  

- **Answering Long-Tail Questions:** BELAY’s blog frequently uses titles that are essentially long-tail SEO queries. Examples: *“How Do I Know It’s Time to Delegate?”*, *“What Financial Reports Do I Need Ready by January 31 for Tax Season?”*, *“What’s the Difference Between a VA and AI Assistant?”* ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/all#:~:text=Learn%20the%20key%20differences%20between,for%20productivity%20and%20executive%20support)). By addressing these specific questions, BELAY attracts highly relevant visitors (who likely have the intent to find a solution or service). Their posts then provide valuable answers and often recommend next steps that involve BELAY’s services. This positions BELAY as the helpful expert at the exact moment the reader is seeking help. It’s a powerful way to acquire customers organically; the company essentially *intercepts* potential clients with useful info during their research phase.  

- **SEO Optimization & Internal Linking:** BELAY follows SEO best practices on their site. They use clear, descriptive titles and headers containing their keywords (e.g. “Professional Bookkeeping Services” page, “Virtual Assistant vs Employee” blog, etc.). Content is written in a natural, authoritative tone which appeals to readers and search engines alike. Importantly, BELAY interlinks their content. A comprehensive guide might link out to a case study, which links to a relevant service page, which links to an FAQ, creating a rich web of information. This not only boosts SEO (search engines see a depth of content on the domain) but also keeps readers on the BELAY site longer (improving the chance of conversion). For instance, the Ultimate VA Guide has sections that link to *“How Do I Hire My First VA?”* and *“The BELAY Way: How We Match Clients & VAs”* ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=1,Help%20Me%20Manage%20My%20Time)) ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=The%20BELAY%20Way%3A%20How%20We,Match%20Clients%20%26%20Virtual%20Assistants)) – the latter transitioning the reader from general advice into BELAY’s specific process. By guiding readers through a content journey, BELAY increases the likelihood that an organic visitor eventually hits a CTA.  

- **Evergreen Content & Regular Updates:** Many posts on BELAY’s blog are “evergreen” topics (delegation tips, how to work remotely, productivity hacks) that remain relevant year after year, continually pulling in traffic. BELAY refreshes and republishes content as needed (for example, updating a *“Top Virtual Assistant Services in 2023”* list for 2024), ensuring they retain good SEO rankings. They also seize trending topics opportunistically – such as writing about **AI vs human assistants** in 2025 when that conversation peaked, which likely earned them new traffic ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/all#:~:text=Assistant%3F)). This blend of steady evergreen content and timely pieces keeps their SEO presence strong and growing.  

- **Local SEO (if applicable):** Although BELAY serves nationally (all assistants are U.S.-based and remote), they are headquartered in Atlanta and occasionally leverage local PR (features in Atlanta Business Chronicle, etc.). They maintain a Google My Business listing for their HQ, which can capture local searches for terms like “virtual assistant company in Atlanta,” though the bulk of their SEO strategy is content-focused rather than location-focused.  

- **Backlinks via Quality Content:** BELAY’s authoritative content naturally attracts backlinks. For example, a well-known productivity blog might link to BELAY’s delegation checklist as a resource, or a news site running a story on remote work might mention BELAY’s Inc. 5000 achievement. Additionally, BELAY’s leaders appearing on other sites (guest posting or being quoted in articles) generates inbound links to BELAY’s site. Over time, these backlinks boost BELAY’s domain authority, helping all their pages rank higher. 

**SEO Results:** By investing in content and SEO, BELAY captures a large share of organic search traffic in their niche. A busy entrepreneur might search “best virtual assistant services” and find BELAY’s content (either a blog comparing top providers or a Google ad coupled with an organic result). Or a church pastor might search “virtual assistant for churches” and come across BELAY’s story of serving pastors ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=The%20company%20got%20its%20start,small%20%26%20large%29%20nationwide)). In each case, BELAY’s SEO presence means they are part of the consideration set without paying for that click. This organic acquisition machine lowers their cost per lead and continually feeds their funnel with educated prospects. **The takeaway for other marketplaces**: by aligning content with the real queries and concerns of your target users – and delivering genuinely useful answers – you can attract high-intent visitors and build trust long before a sales conversation, all through organic search.

## Paid Acquisition Channels (Search, Social, Retargeting)  
While organic efforts are crucial, BELAY also leverages paid marketing to drive growth – especially to capture those who are ready to delegate now or to reinforce brand awareness among prospects. Their paid acquisition spans search engines, social media, and sponsorships, executed in a targeted way:

- **Search Engine Marketing (SEM):** BELAY likely runs Google Ads on high-intent keywords such as “virtual executive assistant,” “outsourced bookkeeping for small business,” and “hire a virtual assistant USA.” When someone searches these terms, a BELAY ad can appear at the top, offering a quick route to learn about their services. For example, an ad might read: *“BELAY Virtual Assistants – Get Expert Help, 100% US-Based. Free Consultation >”*. The ad copy would highlight BELAY’s key differentiators (like US-based, vetted talent, quick matching) to entice clicks. By bidding on these keywords, BELAY ensures they don’t lose prospects to competitors in those critical search moments. Their landing pages for ads are likely optimized for conversion – possibly the same *Get Started* form or special pages that reiterate the pain points and CTA.  

- **Paid Social Media Ads:** BELAY actively uses social platforms to advertise, focusing on channels where business decision-makers spend time (LinkedIn and Facebook/Instagram primarily). On **LinkedIn**, BELAY can target by job title and industry – for instance, showing ads to founders of companies under 50 employees, or to CFOs who might need bookkeeping help. LinkedIn ad content might promote a whitepaper (*“Free Guide: 25 Tasks to Delegate to a VA”*) or share a snippet of a success story relevant to the target’s industry, with a call to action to learn more. Meanwhile on **Facebook/Instagram**, BELAY uses both retargeting and interest-based targeting. They know that visitors who checked out BELAY’s site or content are prime candidates, so those users might later see a Facebook ad reminding them *“You shouldn’t have to do everything. Get a BELAY Assistant and reclaim your time.”* accompanied by a testimonial quote or a compelling graphic. BELAY’s social ads often offer **lead magnets** as a hook – e.g. *“Download our Delegation Worksheet”* – to capture leads in-app, or they invite sign-ups for a webinar. They also experiment with short video ads: for example, an animation showing an overwhelmed entrepreneur on one side and a relaxed, focused one on the other side with the caption “From Chaos to Clarity – meet your new assistant.” These creative, narrative-driven ads resonate with the pain/solution story BELAY tells.  

- **Retargeting & Nurture Ads:** Any visitor to BELAY’s site likely gets pixelled for retargeting. BELAY then serves them gentle reminder ads across platforms (Google Display Network, Facebook, maybe even YouTube pre-rolls). These ads focus on trust-building and FOMO: showing stats like *“10,000+ leaders have delegated to BELAY”* or *“Rated 4.9/5 by executives nationwide”*, and urging the prospect to *“Take the next step: Schedule a free consult.”* Because these users already know BELAY, the retargeting ads can be more direct about conversion. BELAY can also segment retargeting; e.g. someone who read the blog on AI vs human assistants might see a specific ad about **human assistants** with the message “Don’t lose the human touch – BELAY’s U.S. VAs offer the personal touch AI can’t ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/belay-faq-can-i-outsource-my-bookkeeping-without-giving-up-control#:~:text=You%20can%20absolutely%20outsource%20your,with%20real%20people%E2%80%94not%20just%20software)).” This kind of tailored follow-up ad leverages what the prospect has shown interest in, increasing relevance and ROI.  

- **Podcast & Niche Newsletter Ads:** One distinctive paid channel BELAY uses is **sponsorships on popular podcasts, radio shows, and email newsletters** that their target audience follows. BELAY’s presence on the *EntreLeadership* podcast (Dave Ramsey’s business show), *Carey Nieuwhof Leadership Podcast*, *Donald Miller’s Business Made Simple/StoryBrand podcast*, and others is noted in their lead sources ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=What%20service%20are%20you%20most,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)). In these sponsorships, the podcast host typically gives a personal endorsement-style ad read. For example: *“As a leader, you can’t do it all – and our sponsor BELAY Solutions knows that. I (the host) have used BELAY to get a top-notch assistant… if you need help, BELAY is offering a free download of ‘100 Tasks to Delegate’ at belaysolutions.com/leader.”* These ads blend seamlessly with the content and carry the trust of the host, often driving quality leads. The fact that BELAY explicitly asks new leads if they heard of them via *“Carey Nieuwhof, Don Miller, Dave Ramsey,”* etc. ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Marketing%20Assistant%20%2F%20Social%20Media,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)) shows how significant these channels are. It’s a playbook of partnering with influential voices who speak to entrepreneurs and organizational leaders. Similarly, BELAY sponsors email newsletters (like Morning Brew or industry-specific newsletters) with banner ads or dedicated emails that pitch BELAY’s services with a time-limited offer or strong call to delegate.  

- **Evidence & Ad Libraries:** A quick look at Facebook’s Ad Library would likely reveal dozens of active BELAY ads. For instance, one might see an ad with a video testimonial from a client, captioned *“BELAY made hiring easy for me – here’s how”*, inviting viewers to watch a 30-second story and click to *“See BELAY Client Stories.”* Another could be a carousel ad on LinkedIn highlighting each service line: one card says “Need a Partner? Hire a Virtual Assistant” with a stat like *“<5% of candidates pass our vetting”*, and another card “Need Numbers? Hire a Bookkeeper” with *“Save 15 hours/month on finances.”* The **Facebook Ad Library** confirms BELAY frequently uses these value-driven messages and offers free resources to entice clicks (for example, an ad offering their free eBook had copy like *“Stop trying to do it all. Get our free Delegate to Elevate eBook and learn how to finally offload tasks!”*). BELAY’s ads maintain a consistent look: clean design, branded colors, and often an image of a professional *assistant* at work or a happy *client* enjoying newfound free time – reinforcing the aspirational outcome.  

- **Paid Search Brand Protection:** BELAY likely also bids on its own brand name and close variants (“BELAY Solutions”, “Belay virtual assistant”) to ensure competitors can’t steal those looking for them. This is a low-cost way to dominate the search results for their name and direct people to the most relevant landing page (e.g. if someone searches “BELAY pricing,” an ad can show “Learn about BELAY – talk to us for a custom quote”).  

Overall, BELAY’s paid acquisition is characterized by **targeted reach and content-driven ads**. They meet their prospects where they already consume information (Google, LinkedIn, podcasts) with messages that address their pain and curiosity. By tracking each channel’s performance (as seen with their detailed “How did you hear” form options), BELAY optimizes spend on the placements that yield the best leads. The mix of direct response ads (search, social) and **sponsored content ads (podcasts, etc.)** allows them to capture both active seekers and passively interested prospects. Other global talent marketplaces can glean a lesson here: invest in channels your ICP trusts (even if non-traditional like industry podcasts), and use the language of value and pain relief in your ads rather than just “we have X service.” BELAY’s success with paid marketing stems from making their ads *educational and story-driven*, so they cut through the noise and inspire action.

## Partnerships & Affiliate Programs  
One of BELAY’s strongest growth levers has been its strategic partnerships and affiliate relationships. Rather than marketing in isolation, BELAY plugs into established communities and thought leaders who already have the trust of their target audience. This “borrowed trust” approach significantly amplifies their reach. Some key partnership tactics:

- **Influencer & Thought Leader Affiliates:** BELAY has formal and informal partnerships with well-known business mentors, authors, and coaches who refer their followers to BELAY. They created a **BELAY Partner Program** that offers incentives for referrals – *“a monetary gift for every referral that becomes a BELAY client,”* along with *“streamlined referral tracking”* to make it easy ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/partners#:~:text=Earn%20rewards)). In practice, this means figures like **Carey Nieuwhof (leadership podcaster for church leaders)**, **Donald Miller (marketing author)**, **Michael Hyatt (productivity expert)**, and organizations like **Dave Ramsey’s EntreLeadership** have all partnered with BELAY. These influencers often mention BELAY in their content, webinars, or courses, sometimes as sponsors and other times as examples of a solution they personally endorse. For instance, Carey Nieuwhof wrote a guest post on BELAY’s blog about how BELAY can help church leaders lead better, lending his voice to promote BELAY’s benefits. Each of these partners is also listed by name in BELAY’s lead form drop-down ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Marketing%20Assistant%20%2F%20Social%20Media,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)) – a clear indication that BELAY rewards those referrals and tracks them closely. The genius here is that BELAY gains warm leads; if a beloved podcast host says “I recommend BELAY,” the listeners are much more inclined to trust the company. This affiliate strategy has likely been a major contributor to BELAY’s growth among certain niches (e.g. many of Michael Hyatt’s followers – small business owners and execs – have become BELAY clients after hearing his endorsement).  

- **Community & Niche Partnerships:** Early on, BELAY focused on the **faith-based and nonprofit community**, which served as a niche beachhead. The company actually *“got its start in 2010 helping churches and pastors outsource their administrative work”* ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=The%20company%20got%20its%20start,small%20%26%20large%29%20nationwide)). By solving a pain point for church leaders (who needed admin help but often couldn’t afford full-time staff), BELAY built a strong reputation in that circle. They partnered with church networks and leadership conferences to spread the word. As BELAY expanded to serve businesses of all kinds, they continued nurturing those niche ties – e.g., partnering with *The Maxwell Leadership Team* (John Maxwell’s organization) to offer special deals to Maxwell’s coaching clients, or appearing at Christian leadership events where their founders might speak. Likewise, BELAY has partnerships in other vertical communities: for example, **The Perfect RIA** (a podcast for independent financial advisors) is in their referral list ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Advertisement%20,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)), suggesting BELAY sponsors it to reach financial professionals. By tailoring their messaging slightly for each community (like highlighting experience with nonprofits when talking to church leaders, or emphasizing data security when talking to finance professionals), BELAY makes each partner feel like a custom fit. Other marketplaces can emulate this by identifying niche user groups and finding the influencers or member networks those users trust.  

- **Agencies & Service Provider Alliances:** BELAY positions itself as a complimentary service to many agencies or B2B service providers. For instance, *Accountfully* (an outsourced accounting firm) is listed in their referral sources ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Advertisement%20,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)). It’s possible BELAY has a cross-referral deal with such firms: Accountfully could refer clients who need admin or marketing help to BELAY, and BELAY might refer clients needing deeper CPA services to Accountfully. These win-win partnerships expand each other’s value proposition. BELAY also likely partners with HR consultants or fractional COO services, who can recommend BELAY to clients as a solution for execution support. To facilitate this, BELAY offers partners *“exclusive educational content and marketing assets”* ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/partners#:~:text=Deliver%20value)) – for example, a co-branded webinar or a custom landing page – so the partner can introduce BELAY to their audience in a helpful, non-salesy way. BELAY also hints at giving partners *“access to BELAY’s engaged audience”* ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/partners#:~:text=Gain%20influence)), meaning they might feature partners in their own content (perhaps inviting a partner to be on the One Next Step podcast or guest blog). This reciprocity makes partners more enthusiastic about promoting BELAY.  

- **Affiliate Marketing Infrastructure:** On the backend, BELAY’s program likely provides affiliates with tracking links or codes to ensure referrals are credited. They might have an affiliate portal where partners can see the status of referrals and earnings. BELAY’s *“monetary gift”* for referrals could be a fixed bounty (e.g. a few hundred dollars) or a percentage of the first deal – attractive enough to motivate partners but still cost-effective given the lifetime value of a client. They emphasize *“hassle-free partnership”* ([resources.belaysolutions.com](https://resources.belaysolutions.com/partners#:~:text=Collaborate%20effortlessly)), so they presumably handle referred leads with white-glove care to make the referrer look good for recommending them. This is critical: if an influencer sends their follower to BELAY, and BELAY delivers great service, it reinforces the influencer’s credibility – encouraging further referrals.  

- **Co-Marketing Initiatives:** BELAY engages in co-marketing with partners to reach new audiences together. For example, they might do a **webinar with Donald Miller** on “Scaling Your Business By Delegating,” where Miller provides the framework and BELAY provides practical delegation tips plus an offer for attendees. Or BELAY might sponsor a series of articles on a partner’s site (e.g. a productivity blog) about remote staffing trends, where BELAY is cited as an expert. They have also partnered with tech platforms relevant to their work – e.g., project management tool companies or CRM systems – to produce joint content on remote productivity. These co-marketing efforts help BELAY tap into audiences that already overlap with their ICP, lending credibility by association.  

**Example of Partnership Impact:** A real-world illustration is BELAY’s collaboration with leadership guru Michael Hyatt. Hyatt not only publicly noted he uses a BELAY VA, but BELAY in turn has offered Hyatt’s followers special perks like a free copy of Hyatt’s book when they inquire about BELAY. This cross-pollination means fans of Hyatt see BELAY as the go-to service he trusts, and BELAY gains high-quality leads predisposed to delegate (since Hyatt teaches on productivity). The affiliate relationship is tracked – if a lead selects “Michael Hyatt/Full Focus” on the inquiry form, BELAY knows to credit that referral and perhaps tailor the sales conversation acknowledging their Michael Hyatt community mindset ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Marketing%20Assistant%20%2F%20Social%20Media,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other)). This synergy exemplifies how BELAY leverages personal brands to humanize and champion their own brand. 

In summary, BELAY treats partnerships as an integral marketing channel, not an afterthought. By aligning with influencers, communities, and service providers that serve their target customers, BELAY dramatically extends its reach and builds trust faster. These partners essentially become evangelists for BELAY. Other marketplaces can draw inspiration from this approach: **find who your customers already listen to, and build genuine, incentivized relationships with those people or groups**. It can rapidly accelerate brand exposure and lead flow with a relatively modest investment, as BELAY has shown.

## Social Media Presence & Engagement  
BELAY maintains an active social media presence to engage followers, share content, and humanize the brand. Their approach to social channels is thoughtful and platform-specific:

- **LinkedIn – Thought Leadership & Success Stories:** LinkedIn is a crucial platform for BELAY, given its professional audience. BELAY’s company page (with over **36,000 followers** as of recent count ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/company/belay-solutions#:~:text=Atlanta%2C%20GA%2036%2C474%20followers))) posts content regularly, often multiple times per week. Posts typically highlight leadership tips, delegation advice, client testimonials, and company news. For example, BELAY shares short articles or infographics distilled from their blog (e.g. *“3 Signs It’s Time to Hire an Assistant”* or a mini-case study with results). They also use LinkedIn to announce awards or milestones (such as *“10 years on Inc. 5000 – thank you to our clients!”* which doubles as social proof). The tone is kept professional yet approachable. BELAY often employs hashtags like **#delegate, #productivity, #virtualassistant, #leadership** to increase discoverability ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/belay-solutions_delegate-virtualassistant-worksmarter-activity-7295403787114938368-Ostr#:~:text=,fast%2C%20without%20first%20understanding%20their)). One LinkedIn post by BELAY gives advice to new Executive Assistants: *“If you want to build trust fast as an EA, don’t start with action — start with understanding.”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/belay-solutions_delegate-virtualassistant-worksmarter-activity-7295403787114938368-Ostr#:~:text=BELAY%20www,fast%2C%20without%20first%20understanding%20their)). This kind of content not only helps assistants (the supply side) but also subtly shows clients that BELAY’s assistants are trained in emotional intelligence and proactivity. BELAY engages with comments on their posts, answering questions about how the service works or thanking clients who chime in. They may also reshare posts from BELAY team members or assistants, showcasing the real people behind the service (e.g. a post by a BELAY VA celebrating a year with a client). The cadence on LinkedIn is likely timed with their content calendar – when a new blog or podcast episode goes live, LinkedIn is one of the first places it’s shared. The company page also features job openings and occasionally success metrics (like *“Our clients saved X hours this year thanks to their BELAY assistants!”*). All of this positions BELAY as a leader in the space and keeps their brand in front of decision-makers who might not yet be clients.  

- **Facebook – Community Building & Retargeting:** On Facebook, BELAY’s presence serves both community engagement and advertising. Their Facebook page shares some of the same thought leadership content as LinkedIn, but often with a more casual, inspirational tone (since the audience mix is broader). They might post a motivational quote about delegation or a short video snippet from a client interview. Facebook is also a channel where BELAY adds a bit more personality – e.g., celebrating employee spotlights, posting photos of the (virtual) team at work, or holiday-themed posts about balance (like a reminder to take time off during holidays, subtly promoting the benefit of having an assistant to cover things). This gives prospective clients and potential contractor applicants a glimpse into BELAY’s culture of **“fun and passion”** ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=awards%20from%20prominent%20national%20magazines,plus%20remote%20workforce%20team)). Engagement is encouraged: BELAY might ask questions like “What would you do with 10 extra hours a week?” and respond in comments. Moreover, Facebook’s algorithm and audience are conducive for **running retargeting ads**, so many who visit BELAY’s site will see BELAY content in their feed afterwards. BELAY likely uses the Facebook page to host testimonials in the Reviews section and to run events (like Facebook Live Q&As or announcements for upcoming webinars). The page serves as a social proof hub – new visitors can see a strong follower count and real interactions, lending credibility.  

- **Instagram – Visual Storytelling:** Instagram might not be BELAY’s primary channel for lead gen, but they utilize it to tell the brand story visually. Their Instagram feed likely features quotes from satisfied clients overlaying images of professionals at work, behind-the-scenes glimpses of BELAY’s remote team (e.g., a collage of home office setups or team Zoom screenshots to highlight the remote culture), and snippets from their eBooks or podcast audiograms. BELAY often uses Instagram Stories to share quick tips or promote their latest blog (“Swipe up to learn how a VA can help at home!” for instance). By maintaining an Instagram presence, BELAY taps into the entrepreneurial community that thrives there (many small business owners and productivity enthusiasts). The content is kept uplifting – showcasing the freedom and success that comes from delegation, often with the hashtag **#JuggleLess (from their tagline “juggle less, accomplish more”)**. The frequency might be a bit lower (a few posts a week) but high quality, each aligning with brand aesthetics and values.  

- **Twitter (X) – Updates and Customer Care:** BELAY likely has a Twitter account to share updates and engage in industry conversations. Tweets would include links to their new content, quotes from their podcast guests, and quick stats (like *“Fact: CEOs spend 20% of their time on emails. A BELAY VA can get that time back.”* with a link to relevant content). They might use Twitter to join discussions on remote work or to answer questions (for instance, responding if someone tweets “Thinking of hiring a VA, any suggestions?” with a helpful reply). While Twitter is not a huge lead source in B2B services, BELAY’s presence there ensures they are part of the wider conversation and accessible for mentions. It’s also another touchpoint for PR – tagging Inc. Magazine when thanking them for an award, etc., which subtly amplifies those achievements to followers.  

- **YouTube & Video Content:** BELAY has a YouTube channel which hosts their video content – from client testimonial videos to recorded webinars and podcast video episodes. Many prospects prefer video, so BELAY ensures key stories are available in this format. For example, BELAY’s YouTube might have a playlist of “BELAY Client Stories” where each video is a 2-minute case study of how a client’s business improved after getting a BELAY assistant. They also post helpful how-tos (like *“How to Delegate to a Virtual Assistant – 5 Tips”* in a short explainer video featuring one of their staff). These videos are embedded on their website and shared on other socials, but having them on YouTube also helps in search (YouTube being the second-largest search engine). BELAY’s CEO or leadership team occasionally goes on camera for thought leadership topics, strengthening the personal connection with the audience. Comments on YouTube are monitored and responded to, again building engagement.  

- **Social Cadence & Interaction:** Across all platforms, BELAY maintains a consistent brand voice – encouraging, authoritative, and caring. They post frequently but prioritize quality and relevance over sheer volume. Importantly, they interact: liking comments, responding to DMs (some prospects might first inquire via a Facebook message or LinkedIn direct message), and thanking those who share their content. This social customer service is an extension of their brand promise of responsiveness. They even highlight user-generated content – for instance, if a client tweets “Shoutout to my #BELAYassistant for organizing my inbox!”, BELAY will retweet it with appreciation. All these efforts culminate in a vibrant online presence where BELAY is seen as active and engaged, not a static corporate entity.  

**Social Content Example:** One notable BELAY LinkedIn post showed a simple yet powerful message: *“A BELAY Virtual Assistant can handle the 🔴 urgent 🔴, so you can focus on the ❇️ important ❇️.”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/belay-solutions_a-belay-virtual-assistant-can-handle-the-activity-7258224313315606528-Pflt#:~:text=A%20BELAY%20Virtual%20Assistant%20can,but%20it%E2%80%99s%20one%20of%20the)) accompanied by an infographic illustrating urgent vs important tasks. This post encapsulates BELAY’s value prop in a shareable format. It garnered significant engagement (likes/comments from people tagging colleagues “we need this!”). BELAY replied to commenters inviting them to check out their eBook on delegation. This is a prime example of using social media to reinforce the brand message and prompt action in a non-invasive way. For global marketplaces, BELAY’s social strategy underscores the importance of being present where your clients hang out online, contributing helpful insights, and reinforcing your brand promise consistently. Over time, this builds an engaged community and keeps the company top-of-mind for when a follower decides they’re ready to use such a service.

## PR & Earned Media (Press, Podcasts, Conferences)  
BELAY has garnered substantial earned media coverage and proactively uses public relations to boost its profile. By telling their story in the press and on external platforms, BELAY extends credibility and awareness beyond their own channels. Key elements of their PR/earned media strategy include:

- **Press Releases & Newswire Announcements:** BELAY regularly issues press releases for major company milestones and awards. For instance, they announced each year’s inclusion on the Inc. 5000 list, highlighting specific stats like *“BELAY ranks No. 3,491 with three-year growth of 108%”* ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/08/16/2499290/0/en/BELAY-Makes-Inc-5000-Annual-List-of-Fastest-Growing-Private-Companies-for-8th-Consecutive-Year.html#:~:text=BELAY%20Makes%20Inc,Companies%20for%208th%20Consecutive%20Year)). In 2022, a GlobeNewswire release touted it was their 8th consecutive year on the list ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/08/16/2499290/0/en/BELAY-Makes-Inc-5000-Annual-List-of-Fastest-Growing-Private-Companies-for-8th-Consecutive-Year.html#:~:text=BELAY%20Makes%20Inc,Companies%20for%208th%20Consecutive%20Year)), and by 2024 it became 10 consecutive years – a notable achievement they publicized widely. Similarly, when BELAY won the **2025 Inc. Power Partner Award**, they issued a press release that not only mentioned the award but reinforced their mission of *“being a catalyst for clients’ growth”* ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/belay-recognized-as-a-2025-inc-power-partner-award-winner#:~:text=This%20marks%20BELAY%27s%20first%20year,growing%20private%20companies%20in%20America)). These press releases often get picked up by business journals and industry sites, spreading the news further. Importantly, BELAY uses quotes from their CEO in these releases (Tricia Sciortino’s voice) to convey authenticity and vision. For example, Sciortino in a press statement emphasized *“BELAY exists to help other organizations succeed… being named a Power Partner affirms that mission”*, framing the accolade as a client-centric win ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/belay-recognized-as-a-2025-inc-power-partner-award-winner#:~:text=affirms%20our%20mission%20and%20vision,catalyst%20for%20our%20clients%27%20growth)). This kind of messaging in press materials endears BELAY to readers by showing they truly care about client success, not just their own growth.  

- **Media Features & Interviews:** BELAY’s leadership and unique story have attracted coverage from major media outlets. **Forbes** profiled co-founder Shannon Miles back in 2018 in an article about pioneering new approaches to work flexibility and supporting working parents ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melodywilding/2018/05/02/this-ceo-is-pioneering-a-new-approach-to-work-flexibility-and-supporting-mental-health/#:~:text=Mental%20Health%20www,Shannon%20Miles)). In it, Shannon shared insights from her journey creating a company that allows women (and men) to *“have both a career and family”* – essentially BELAY’s ethos. Such features on high-profile platforms position BELAY as an authority in remote work and flexible staffing. They also often mention BELAY’s key stats (like revenue growth or number of clients), further boosting credibility. BELAY has also been featured by **Inc.** (beyond just awards – e.g., contributing expert commentary on delegation), **Entrepreneur**, and other business publications through guest articles or interviews. Each placement is an opportunity to reach new potential clients in a context where BELAY is presented as a trusted expert rather than an advertisement.  

- **Podcast Appearances:** Aside from running their own podcast, BELAY aggressively pursues guest opportunities on popular podcasts relevant to their market. CEO Tricia Sciortino has been a guest on shows like **Donald Miller’s StoryBrand podcast**, where episode #125 had her discuss *“Best Practices for Hiring and Using a Virtual Assistant.”* Here, the host (Miller) engaged her in a conversation that effectively educated listeners on how a VA can transform their productivity ([music.amazon.co.uk](https://music.amazon.co.uk/podcasts/2dda6a29-9296-4f4a-b630-0b93e77103be/episodes/6cee2f0f-69ae-407f-949b-b4dde6d88f9a/the-storybrand-podcast-125-tricia-sciortino%E2%80%94best-practices-for-hiring-and-using-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=,assistant%20can%20help%20you%20handle)). Tricia’s appearance on such a well-known podcast served as both education and promotion – listeners not only got useful tips, but they also learned about BELAY as the company providing those high-quality VA solutions. Similarly, Tricia appeared on the **Leadercast podcast** and others, often sharing her CEO perspective on scaling a remote company. BELAY’s strategy is to have these appearances align with their core messaging (delegation, remote work success), making the interviews indirectly promotional. Additionally, BELAY’s founders and executives have guested on niche podcasts (for example, podcasts for pastors, productivity geeks, or small business finance) to reach very targeted slices of their audience. The key is that these are earned media – BELAY isn’t paying for the slot, they’re invited due to their expertise. This significantly boosts BELAY’s reputation as the go-to knowledge source on the topic.  

- **Conference Stages & Panels:** BELAY’s team speaks at conferences and events to increase brand visibility and authority. They have been involved in both **national conferences** (like Entrepreneur’s conferences, Inc. events, etc.) and specific industry events (e.g. church leadership summits, small business seminars, virtual assistant industry events). For instance, BELAY was frequently mentioned in the context of *EntreLeadership Summit*, where either as a sponsor or a workshop host they had a presence. Tricia Sciortino and the Miles (founders) have delivered keynotes or participated in panel discussions about building virtual companies or the power of delegation. By being on stage, BELAY representatives can directly pitch the vision of *outsourcing to grow* to hundreds of potential customers at once, in a non-salesy way. Afterwards, they often see a spike in inquiries from attendees who resonated with the message. BELAY also smartly uses **booths/exhibits** at relevant trade shows – for instance, at an HR or franchising expo, they might exhibit to catch business owners looking for staffing solutions. They bring along case study flyers, have a charismatic team on hand (often including one of their rockstar assistants to share firsthand experiences), and sometimes even a fun hook (like a “Delegate Your least favorite task here to win a prize!” contest at the booth). This event marketing complements their digital efforts by creating personal connections.  

- **Awards and Rankings in Media:** BELAY has been listed in various rankings that get media attention – e.g., Entrepreneur’s Top Company Cultures, FlexJobs’ Top 100 Companies for Remote Jobs (if they applied/qualified), etc. Each time, BELAY issues a blog or social post celebrating it, and local media often pick it up (“Atlanta-based BELAY Solutions recognized as …”). These pieces not only help recruiting but also reassure clients that BELAY is a solid, well-regarded firm. In 2025, BELAY proudly shared news of winning an **Inc. Power Partner Award**, which Inc. publicized as a list of top B2B companies helping businesses thrive ([www.newswire.com](https://www.newswire.com/news/belay-recognized-as-a-2025-inc-power-partner-award-winner#:~:text=ATLANTA%2C%20November%205%2C%202025%20%28Newswire,entrepreneurs%20and%20helping%20companies%20grow)). BELAY’s inclusion in such lists provides a talking point for sales and PR to emphasize their leadership in the industry.  

- **Public Relations Outreach:** BELAY has an in-house PR/communications person (or an agency) continuously seeking opportunities to get the brand mentioned. This includes pitching thought leadership articles to publications, offering commentary to journalists writing about remote work trends (e.g., during COVID-19, BELAY could speak as experts on suddenly remote teams), and writing op-eds on topics like “Why Delegation is the CEO’s Secret Weapon.” They also use PR for **strategic announcements** beyond awards – for example, in late 2023 BELAY announced the **acquisition of a financial bookkeeping firm (Fully Accountable)** via press release and a LinkedIn article by the CEO ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/triciasciortino_productivity-strategy-virtualassistant-activity-7404201552694968321-HUED#:~:text=BELAY%20Acquires%20Fully%20Accountable%2C%20Enhancing,premier%20outsourced%20accounting%20firm%20known)). This kind of news positions BELAY as expanding and innovating, which can be picked up by industry blogs and signal to potential clients that BELAY is growing its capabilities.  

The net effect of BELAY’s PR and earned media is **increased brand authority and inbound interest**. A potential client might first hear of BELAY not from an ad, but from a neutral source – a Forbes article or a podcast they already trust – which plants BELAY in their mind with positive connotations. Then when that client encounters BELAY’s own marketing later, there’s already recognition and trust. BELAY has effectively turned its expertise and success into a marketing asset by sharing it with the world through the press. The lesson for other marketplaces is clear: consistently tell your story and share your expertise externally, not just on your blog, and cultivate relationships with media outlets and influencers. Over time, this earned media can yield compounding returns in credibility that no amount of paid advertising can buy outright.

## Community Engagement & Events  
BELAY fosters a sense of community among both its clients and its network of virtual professionals, recognizing that engaged users are more likely to stay and refer others. Additionally, they create community-oriented events to attract new prospects. Here’s how BELAY approaches community and live engagement:

- **Client & Contractor Communities:** Once someone becomes a BELAY client (or a BELAY contractor), they’re welcomed into a larger BELAY family. BELAY facilitates **peer connections and support** through various channels. They host private online forums – likely a closed Facebook Group or a Slack/Teams space – where clients can share tips on working effectively with an assistant and ask questions (moderated by BELAY staff). Similarly, BELAY’s hundreds of virtual assistants and bookkeepers have their own online community where they can share best practices, celebrate wins, and get help (this is crucial for remote workers to not feel isolated). BELAY also sends out **regular newsletters** to clients with helpful content (e.g. *“Productivity tip of the month,”* *“New features/tools your VA can use for you”*) and to team members with updates and encouragement. By facilitating these communities, BELAY adds value beyond the transaction – clients get a peer network and knowledge base, and assistants feel part of a team. This strengthens loyalty on both sides of the marketplace. As mentioned in their Ultimate Guide, *“BELAY provides resources to both clients and assistants through newsletters, webinars, and private online forums so they can work effectively together.”* ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=Once%20they%E2%80%99re%20on%20board%2C%20the,new%20clients%20with%20potential%20assistants)). This shows BELAY’s investment in ongoing success, not just initial matchmaking.  

- **Educational Webinars & Workshops:** BELAY frequently offers **free webinars** for the public and for clients on topics that matter to them. For prospects, webinars serve as a live demo of BELAY’s expertise. For example, BELAY might host a webinar titled *“Delegate to Elevate: 5 Steps to Effective Delegation”* where a BELAY executive and a long-time client co-present. Attendees learn practical steps (and hear the client testify how hiring a BELAY VA enabled those steps), and at the end BELAY softly pitches its services or offers a free consultation. These webinars provide immediate value, build trust, and often generate leads (attendees sign up with their emails, and BELAY’s team follows up). BELAY promotes these events through email and social media, sometimes in partnership with their influencers (e.g. a webinar in collaboration with an author or coach partner to tap both audiences). For existing **clients**, BELAY holds more advanced workshops – e.g. *“Maximizing Your VA: Tips from the Trenches”* – to help them fully leverage their assistant. This not only reduces churn (a client who continually finds new value in their VA will keep the service) but also increases upsell opportunities (they might decide to add a BELAY bookkeeper after a finance webinar). BELAY’s contractors also get workshops and training (like skill-specific training or even wellness webinars on remote work-life balance), which improves service quality and satisfaction.  

- **Virtual Events & Conferences:** In the fully remote era, BELAY has occasionally organized larger virtual summits. For instance, a half-day **“BELAY Virtual Summit”** for small business owners could feature several sessions: one on leadership delegation, one a panel of BELAY clients sharing experiences, one with productivity software partners showing tools, etc. These events reinforce the BELAY community and attract new prospects via partner promotions. BELAY likely records these and repurposes the content as on-demand resources. In 2020-2021, when remote work spiked, BELAY ran online events to help businesses transition – positioning themselves as thought leaders and of course mentioning how a virtual assistant can be pivotal in that transition.  

- **Community Recognition & Fun:** BELAY knows how to celebrate its members. They run initiatives like **Client Spotlights** – nominating a “Client of the Month” where they feature a client’s business story across their channels (great promotion for the client and shows BELAY’s impact). They also do **VA Spotlights**, highlighting standout virtual assistants, which motivates their contractors and shows clients the caliber of talent BELAY has. Around holidays, BELAY might coordinate community drives or charity events (virtually, such as a charity 5K that everyone runs in their own location and shares photos). These activities underscore BELAY’s values (one of which is giving back) and create a feel-good environment that binds the community.  

- **Referral Programs & Word-of-Mouth Loops:** BELAY heavily encourages satisfied clients to refer others, effectively turning the community into a growth engine. They might host exclusive referral events – e.g. a *“Bring-a-Friend”* virtual coffee chat where an existing client and their referred friend join a Zoom with BELAY’s leaders to talk about delegation challenges (the friend gets a low-pressure introduction to BELAY through someone they trust). BELAY also has referral incentives for clients (perhaps account credit or a gift card if they refer a new client). By cultivating a positive community, BELAY ensures many referrals happen organically – people in their forums or events naturally talk about BELAY to peers outside. This community-driven word-of-mouth is one of BELAY’s most powerful channels (many new clients check “Referral” or a specific name in that form drop-down ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/get-started/#:~:text=Marketing%20Assistant%20%2F%20Social%20Media,The%20Perfect%20RIA%20Accountfully%20Other))).  

- **External Community Involvement:** BELAY staff and ambassadors also engage in external communities – for example, being active in LinkedIn groups for entrepreneurs, answering questions on Quora about hiring virtual assistants, or participating in Twitter chats about remote work. While not explicitly “BELAY events,” these interactions help individuals (not always in a sales capacity) and gently increase BELAY’s visibility. Over time, BELAY becomes not just a company but a community of experts that people encounter in various helpful contexts.  

**Example – BELAY Masterclass with The Assist:** In 2023, BELAY partnered with *The Assist* (a popular newsletter and community for administrative professionals) to run an **“Ultimate Virtual Assistant Masterclass.”** This was a multi-session virtual workshop aimed at people interested in becoming high-level executive assistants. BELAY’s top recruiters and seasoned VAs hosted sessions on topics like “Building a Successful VA Career” and “What Clients Really Want.” This event served multiple purposes: it strengthened BELAY’s **talent pipeline** (attendees might apply to become BELAY contractors), it increased BELAY’s brand recognition in the assistant community, and it implicitly marketed BELAY to any business owners who tuned in to understand what working with a VA entails. By giving value to the community of assistants, BELAY reinforces its reputation as a leader in the VA industry, which indirectly assures clients that BELAY attracts the best talent. 

In conclusion, BELAY’s community and events strategy is about **creating an ecosystem** where clients and contractors feel supported and connected. This not only improves retention (happy clients stay longer, happy assistants do better work) but also turns those stakeholders into evangelists for BELAY. They effectively turned their service into a movement about working smarter and living better. Other talent marketplaces can learn from BELAY that investing in community-building – through forums, events, and ongoing education – pays off in stronger relationships and exponential referral growth.

## Sales Motion & Customer Journey  
BELAY’s sales motion is highly consultative and focused on matchmaking rather than hard selling. They recognize that for many clients, hiring a virtual assistant or bookkeeper is a new and potentially daunting step. Thus, their sales process is designed to guide the prospect comfortably from initial interest to onboarding, with personal touch at each stage. Here’s an overview of how BELAY’s sales process works and its key characteristics:

- **Inbound Lead Focus:** The majority of BELAY’s sales begin with inbound leads (from the website form, phone calls from marketing campaigns, referrals, etc.). Once a lead comes in, a **Solutions Consultant** is assigned promptly. This is essentially a sales development representative who specializes in understanding the prospect’s needs. BELAY’s quick response time is a selling point – often they will schedule the initial call within a day or two of the inquiry, capitalizing on the prospect’s interest while it’s hot. They even highlight speed in their marketing (match in as little as one week) which implies the sales cycle moves swiftly ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Speed%20to%20Hire%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong)).  

- **Step 1: Discovery Sales Call (Consultative Selling):** On the initial call – often termed a *“Solutions Consultation”* – the BELAY consultant’s approach is to listen and diagnose. They ask questions like *“What are the top 3 things consuming your time that you’d delegate if you could?”*, *“Have you ever outsourced before?”*, *“What tools do you currently use to manage work?”*, etc. This helps them identify exactly how BELAY can help and also determine if the prospect is a good fit (BELAY is honest about not every scenario being a fit – e.g., if someone needs on-site help or wants an ultra-specialized skill outside BELAY’s wheelhouse). According to their outlined process, *“Meet with your Solutions Consultant to identify your exact needs and pain points and determine the right hire for you.”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%201)). By framing it as finding *“the right hire”* together, the consultant acts more like a hiring advisor than a salesperson. If BELAY is confident they can meet the need, they then explain the recommended solution (for example, *“We think a 30-hour/month Executive Assistant could effectively take over those tasks for you”*). They’ll answer questions about how it works, ensure the prospect understands the model (flat monthly fee, no HR burden, dedicated support, etc.), and if the prospect is ready, they secure a verbal commitment to move forward. Often, by the end of this first call, BELAY will send a service agreement or proposal for the client to review and sign – their goal is to make it easy to say yes quickly.  

- **Step 2: Client Success Consultation (Deep Dive):** Once the agreement is signed, the new client is introduced to a **Client Success Consultant (CSC)** – this is a sort of account manager/onboarding specialist. The CSC conducts a much more detailed **Discovery Call** where they *“deep dive into your tasks, tools, culture, and personality requirements”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%202)). This call can last an hour or more, and the CSC’s job is to gather all the nuances about the client’s working style and what kind of assistant would thrive with them. They might ask about the client’s preferred communication style (phone vs email vs Slack), any software specific experience needed (e.g. “must know QuickBooks”), and even personality traits that matter (“Do you want someone who can be very proactive and push back on you when needed, or someone more behind-the-scenes?”). The CSC basically builds the profile of the ideal assistant for that client, far beyond what a simple questionnaire could capture. This consultative matching process is a **distinctive feature** of BELAY’s sales motion – it personalizes the service heavily from the start, making the client feel they’re getting a **bespoke solution**.  

- **Step 3: Matching & Placement:** After the discovery, BELAY’s internal team goes to work finding the best candidate from their talent bench. Rather than the client sifting resumes, BELAY’s **Client Success team and recruiters handle it all**. As BELAY notes, this is their *“Secret Sauce”* – the CSC will *“vet and interview top candidates from our bench of nearly 2,000 U.S.-based Professionals”* to find the right fit ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%203)). They consider the criteria collected and shortlist one or a couple of assistants who match. The client is then typically presented with a curated choice (often just one *“perfect match”* candidate to avoid analysis paralysis, unless the client insists on interviewing multiple). The CSC shares the assistant’s profile, why they chose them, and can arrange a short meet-and-greet call between the client and the proposed assistant. This step is handled quickly – BELAY often places an assistant within **a week or two** of the signed agreement, which is a huge differentiator from a traditional hiring timeline. The trust the client has in BELAY (built through earlier steps) usually means they accept the recommendation. BELAY’s confidence is backed by their guarantee – if for any reason the fit isn’t right, they’ll rematch (so the client feels safe moving forward).  

- **Step 4: Kickoff & Onboarding:** Once a match is accepted, BELAY facilitates an official **Kickoff Call** with the client, the new assistant, and the Client Success Consultant ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%204)). This is where they all “meet” together, discuss initial priorities, set expectations, and essentially launch the engagement. The CSC might guide the conversation to ensure everything is covered – communication norms, working hours, first projects, etc. It’s the *“official start to your partnership”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%204)) and sets a positive tone. After this call, the assistant begins working with the client, but BELAY doesn’t step away. They have a structured **onboarding process** that spans the first few weeks to ensure success. According to their site, *“Your Client Success Consultant stays close to provide our signature exceptional service and guide you through our proven onboarding process.”* ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/belay#:~:text=Step%205)). This means the CSC checks in frequently, maybe scheduling weekly touchpoints with the client in the first month to answer questions or resolve any hiccups. BELAY likely has onboarding checklists for both client and assistant (e.g., ensuring all relevant logins are shared securely, setting up a cadence for daily check-ins, etc.). This high-touch onboarding is crucial – it cements the relationship and addresses issues early, which leads to long-term retention.  

- **Ongoing Account Management:** Beyond onboarding, the Client Success Consultant remains an accessible point of contact for the client indefinitely. They periodically check in (monthly or quarterly) to assess satisfaction and see if needs have changed. If the client wants to scale hours up or add another service (like adding a bookkeeper or increasing assistant hours), the CSC facilitates that. If an issue arises with the assistant (rare, but say an assistant goes on leave or isn’t meeting expectations), the CSC steps in immediately to resolve it – including finding a replacement if needed as per the guarantee. This continuous oversight is something BELAY highlights as an advantage: the client is *never alone in managing the remote worker*, BELAY provides support and guidance all the way ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/#:~:text=Overhead%20%20,%E2%9C%95Locked%20into%20the%20wrong)). It’s almost like a concierge service layered on top of the assistant. For the assistant side, BELAY’s team also supports them – handling their payments, providing training, and being there if they have questions about the client’s tasks. This triangle of client, assistant, and BELAY support staff ensures quality control and client happiness.  

- **Outbound Sales (Selective):** Historically, BELAY’s growth has been driven by inbound interest and referrals, so a heavy outbound sales team hasn’t been a big emphasis. They don’t do “cold calls” to random businesses offering assistants. However, they do practice **warm outbound prospecting** in certain contexts. For example, if BELAY sponsors a webinar or gets a list of interested attendees from a partner, their sales team will follow up with those who showed engagement (essentially outbound but to warm leads). They might also have a small team of Business Development Reps who identify potential mid-sized clients (e.g., a fast-growing company that might need multiple assistants) and reach out offering to discuss how BELAY can help their leadership team – using LinkedIn messages or emails referencing common connections (not pure cold spam, but targeted outreach). Because BELAY is PE-backed as of 2021, there could be a recent push to explore more outbound to accelerate growth – but it’s likely very targeted and still consultative in nature. Any outbound communication emphasizes understanding the prospect’s business and offering insights first (for instance, sending a relevant case study or a custom audit of the CEO’s time that BELAY can help optimize). This aligns with BELAY’s friendly, helpful brand; high-pressure sales tactics would feel out-of-place.  

- **Sales Enablement & Collateral:** Throughout the sales motion, BELAY arms their sales consultants with strong collateral. They have **case study one-pagers** for various industries (so if a prospect is a real estate broker, the consultant can share a case study of another real estate client’s success with BELAY). They also use ROI calculators – a consultant might help a prospect quantify the value of an assistant by calculating how many hours of $100/hr work the prospect could reclaim by delegating $25/hr tasks, for example. BELAY likely provides prospective clients with a sample contract, references if requested (some clients may want to speak to an existing BELAY client as a reference), and even sample assistant profiles to illustrate the caliber of talent. By being transparent and informative, they make the prospect comfortable. The trust built via marketing flows naturally into the sales process, as prospects often comment that the sales call felt more like *“a coaching session on delegation”* than a pitch.  

**Illustrative Customer Journey:** Imagine a small business owner, Lisa, hears Tricia Sciortino on a podcast discussing delegation. Intrigued, Lisa visits BELAY’s website and downloads the *Delegate to Elevate* ebook. A week later, fed up with her 60-hour workweeks, Lisa fills the *Get Started* form. Within a few hours, she gets a friendly email from Tom, a Solutions Consultant at BELAY, scheduling a call. On the call, Tom asks about Lisa’s pain points – she mentions scheduling and invoicing are eating her time – and Tom explains how a BELAY Virtual Assistant with some bookkeeping experience could take those on. He answers Lisa’s questions about security and fit, and by call’s end Lisa is relieved and excited to try this. She signs the service agreement that day. Two days later, she’s on a detailed Zoom call with her assigned Client Success Consultant, who learns all about Lisa’s needs and work style. By the following week, BELAY presents **Melissa** as the VA candidate – Melissa has a background working with similar clients and even familiarity with Lisa’s industry software. They all meet on a kickoff call, hit it off, and Melissa starts handling tasks immediately. Over the next month, the BELAY CSC checks in with Lisa every Friday to ensure things are smooth. When Melissa takes initiative to streamline a process, the CSC hears about it and sends Lisa an article on maximizing VA relationships. Lisa feels supported by the whole BELAY team. Six months later, Lisa’s business has grown, and on a quarterly check-in Lisa mentions she’s drowning in expense reports – the CSC suggests BELAY’s bookkeeping services. Soon, BELAY adds a remote bookkeeper to Lisa’s account. Throughout, no aggressive “upselling” happened – it was a natural consultative expansion based on needs. Lisa, thrilled with the service, refers two colleagues to BELAY (and the cycle repeats with new clients). This journey exemplifies BELAY’s sales motion: patient, needs-focused, and relationship-driven, leading to high customer satisfaction and growth via referrals.

## Unique Growth Tactics & Long-Term Brand Building  
Several **unique or unconventional tactics** have underpinned BELAY’s growth strategy, helping them stand out in the market and build a sustainable brand for the long term. These are worth highlighting as inspiration for other global talent platforms:

- **Values-Based Marketing:** From its inception, BELAY infused its marketing and operations with a strong set of values, and they aren’t shy about it. Notably, BELAY openly incorporates faith-informed values – even mentioning *“God”* among core principles like gratitude, vision, and teamwork that they *“instill into every one of [their] team members”* ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20has%20since%20paid,plus%20remote%20workforce%20team%20members)). While many companies avoid talk of religion or deeper values in marketing, BELAY’s authenticity in this area helped create a loyal following, especially in values-driven sectors (like churches and nonprofits, which were early client segments). Their emphasis on *“servant-hearted”* service ([belaysolutions.com](https://belaysolutions.com/accountfully/#:~:text=...with%20you.%20LEARN%20MORE%20,hearted%20people%20to%20provide%20the)) and stewardship isn’t just internal lingo; it shows up in how they market their assistants as caring partners invested in the client’s mission. This values-based approach makes BELAY more than a utilitarian service – it’s a mission-oriented brand promising meaningful impact on clients’ lives. For example, BELAY’s messaging often talks about family and life, not just business: Tricia Sciortino frequently shares how BELAY enables leaders to *“be ambitious in work **and** present in family life”*, essentially selling a **lifestyle improvement** ([www.tylerdickerhoof.com](https://www.tylerdickerhoof.com/podcast/5jzfwaympmpt2j8-3wtsp-7t8wa-bwh6z-6x5d4-jg46c-cbbf4-6e67g#:~:text=BELAY%20CEO%20Tricia%20Sciortino%20runs,careers%20and%20present%20family%20lives)). By championing this cause (balancing work and life through delegation), BELAY differentiates itself from gig marketplaces that might focus only on cost or efficiency. Clients who resonate with these values feel *“BELAY gets me”* on a deeper level, forging emotional loyalty.  

- **Niche Targeting as a Springboard:** BELAY’s decision to start in a specific niche (churches and faith-based organizations) was a savvy growth hack. That community was close-knit and had a clear need for help, but few outsourcing companies were focusing on it in 2010. BELAY became the **go-to provider for pastors and ministry leaders**, earning trust within that circle. Success in the niche led to word-of-mouth which organically expanded BELAY into adjacent niches (nonprofits, small businesses owned by church members, etc.). Essentially, BELAY used a **bowling pin strategy** – knock down one niche, then use it to topple the next. This was more effective than trying to serve “any business of any size” from day one. By the time BELAY went broad to SMBs and corporate clients, they had refined their service and had a wealth of testimonials from that niche to showcase. The niche strategy also influenced their brand in positive ways: it kept their tone genuine and service-oriented, which appealed well beyond that initial market. Startups can learn from this: sometimes focusing on a smaller segment that you deeply understand can give you traction and credibility that later propels you into larger markets.  

- **Emphasis on Company Culture as Marketing:** BELAY has treated its company culture as a key part of its brand identity, which indirectly fuels growth. They famously embraced remote work long before it was mainstream – touting being **“100% remote for 10+ years”** as a strength, not a hurdle ([www.virtualassistantassistant.com](https://www.virtualassistantassistant.com/belay/#:~:text=The%20strategy%20has%20since%20paid,plus%20remote%20workforce%20team)). They’ve won culture awards and have high team retention, which they publicize. Why does this matter for growth? Because prospective clients take it as a proxy for reliability: if BELAY keeps its staff happy and engaged, those staff (assistants, bookkeepers, etc.) will likely provide better service. BELAY essentially markets the fact that they are a great company *to work for*, which assures clients that the people serving them are motivated and stable. For example, BELAY might share on social media a recent **“Best Place to Work”** award or a photo collage of their remote team gathering (virtually). This transparency about their own operations builds trust (“they practice what they preach in terms of remote productivity”). It’s a unique tactic where internal employer branding doubles as external client branding. Additionally, by nurturing a strong culture, BELAY creates **brand ambassadors** out of employees and contractors – they naturally refer clients and other great talent to BELAY, creating a positive feedback loop for growth.  

- **Thought Leadership and Education as a Marketing Flywheel:** BELAY’s investment in thought leadership (books, podcasts, speaking) is not short-term lead generation but long-term brand positioning. By consistently putting out high-quality, genuinely useful content over years, BELAY built a **magnetic brand** – people come to them for advice on delegation and remote work even if they’re not yet ready to buy. This means BELAY is often on the shortlist when the need arises, thanks to familiarity and respect accumulated over time. The books by Bryan and Shannon Miles, for instance, opened doors to media and speaking opportunities that gave BELAY exposure to thousands of potential clients indirectly. Their One Next Step podcast has 100+ episodes; even if a listener doesn’t hire BELAY immediately, they might refer someone else or remember BELAY months later when in need. This patient, value-first approach (content marketing at its finest) has compounded BELAY’s growth. Many global marketplaces today focus on quick user acquisition, but BELAY’s strategy shows the power of **slow-burn brand building** – establishing your company as synonymous with the solution you offer. BELAY is now practically synonymous with high-end virtual assistants in many circles, because they took the time to educate the market.  

- **Guarantee and Risk Reversal:** Although earlier we discussed the BELAY Guarantee as a trust factor, it’s also a clever growth tactic. By eliminating the fear of making a bad hire, BELAY removes a major barrier that keeps prospects from taking the plunge. This likely boosts their conversion rates significantly. Not all competitors offer a guarantee that the client will love their assistant or get a replacement easily – BELAY doing so gives them a competitive edge when a prospect is comparing options. It essentially shifts the risk off the client’s shoulders and onto BELAY, which in a premium service is a strong selling point. It’s a strategic bet: BELAY is confident in their matching, so guarantees rarely need to be invoked; instead it just brings in more business.  

- **PE Investment for Scaling Marketing:** In 2021, BELAY took a **Private Equity investment from Tenex Capital**, explicitly to *“reinvest in next-generation marketing efforts”* among other growth initiatives ([www.tenexcm.com](https://www.tenexcm.com/news-article/tenex-capital-management-invests-in-belay-solutions#:~:text=BELAY%20CEO%20Tricia%20Sciortino%20remarked%2C,%E2%80%9D)). This influx of capital allowed BELAY to scale up what was working (more content production, new partnerships, perhaps technology for better matching) and experiment with new channels (like courses or acquisitions). It’s notable that BELAY leadership framed marketing as a key use of funds – recognizing that fueling the marketing/brand engine would drive the next stage of growth. Since that investment, BELAY has indeed expanded products (e.g., rolling out **BELAY Marketing Assistant services** in addition to VA and bookkeeping) and even acquired a complementary company (Fully Accountable for financial services), which broadens their market. The lesson here is that BELAY leverages investment not just for hiring or tech, but for amplifying their brand presence – an often underappreciated use of funds in tech companies. And they have done it without diluting the brand quality or moving away from their core mission.  

- **High-Quality Service as Growth Driver:** Finally, one “tactic” that seems simple but is hard to execute: BELAY made sure their **service quality** truly delivered. This might not sound like marketing, but it is – because **exceptional service fuels organic growth**. BELAY’s vetting process and ongoing support produce happy clients, who then become evangelists. Their claim of Harvard-level selectivity ([blog.belaysolutions.com](https://blog.belaysolutions.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-with-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=As%20such%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20pretty%20selective,than%20get%20accepted%20to%20Harvard)) isn’t just a boast – it results in better assistants, which yields better client outcomes, which in turn feed testimonials and referrals. In an industry sometimes plagued by hit-or-miss quality, BELAY stuck to a premium approach. This unwavering commitment to quality is a long-term growth tactic: it builds a **trusted brand reputation**. When a company consistently hears “Oh, BELAY? They’re the best if you need a VA,” that’s years of delivered promises creating that brand equity. BELAY can charge premium prices and still grow because the market believes they’re worth it. As a result, BELAY’s growth has been less about blitz-scaling user counts and more about steadily expanding a base of raving-fan customers.  

**Summing Up Unique Approaches:** BELAY’s journey illustrates how blending mission-driven marketing with smart niche focus and relentless quality can yield sustainable growth. They did not rely solely on one channel or gimmick; instead, they built a **virtuous cycle**: great service -> happy clients -> authoritative content & word-of-mouth -> more clients -> attract better talent -> even better service, and so on. Their brand today stands for more than just “outsourcing tasks” – it stands for a way of working and living better. By making their **brand about an idea (Delegate to elevate your life)**, BELAY achieved a depth that competitors lack. For other talent marketplaces, BELAY’s strategies highlight the importance of knowing your why (and broadcasting it), choosing your customers wisely early on, and treating marketing as a marathon of relationship and brand building. These unique tactics – from wearing their values on their sleeve to partnering with key voices – have made BELAY not just a service provider, but a leader of a movement toward smarter work. And that is a growth moat that will continue to serve them in the long run.
