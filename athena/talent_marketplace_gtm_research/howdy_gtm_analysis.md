# Howdy GTM & Marketing Channel Report

## Positioning and Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)  
Howdy.com positions itself as a **premium nearshore talent partner** for U.S. tech companies, specifically those needing skilled software engineers in Latin America ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=)) ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=remote%20equipment%20assets%20and%20benefits,retention%3A%20Developer)). Early on, Howdy focused on Austin startups and YC-backed companies, but its customer base now spans **200+ companies** including scale-ups like Coinbase, Vanta, Truepill, and more ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=Why%20Howdy,Howdy%20is%20deeply%20involved%20in)). The **ideal customer** tends to be B2B SaaS firms or product-driven teams that value fast access to senior engineers and long-term retention over rock-bottom contracting costs ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=)). Howdy explicitly targets companies that want to **“build an engineering outpost”** in LatAm – essentially extending their team with full-time remote employees rather than outsourcing on a project basis ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=engineering%20culture%3A%20When%20you%20partner,space%2C%20Howdy%20fee%20%26%20more)). 

**Why LatAm?** Howdy’s positioning heavily emphasizes Latin America’s strategic advantages for U.S. employers. They frequently cite the **time-zone alignment** – LatAm engineers work in real-time with U.S. teams, avoiding the midnight calls and delays that come with outsourcing to Asia or Eastern Europe ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=The%20time%20zone%20advantage%3A%20real,collaboration)). Culturally and geographically, LatAm is portrayed as the U.S.’s “**own backyard**” talent goldmine ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20default%20answer,their%20own%20backyard%3A%20Latin%20America)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=Latin%20America%20offers%20the%20trifecta,focus%20on%20building%20great%20products)). Additionally, Howdy highlights that companies can **save 60–65% vs. hiring domestically** while still getting “elite” developers ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=While%20cost%20savings%20are%20real%2C,without%20sacrificing%20quality%20or%20communication)). In content, they note LatAm offers the *“trifecta”* of real-time collaboration, high-quality talent, and cost efficiency ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=While%20cost%20savings%20are%20real%2C,without%20sacrificing%20quality%20or%20communication)). This clear positioning (“nearshore talent in LatAm for U.S. tech teams”) not only differentiates Howdy from generic outsourcing but also educates prospects *why* LatAm is the ideal region. *For other global talent marketplaces, Howdy’s example shows the importance of defining a **focused ICP** (e.g. startups vs. enterprise) and clearly answering “Why this region?” in the value proposition.* 

## Differentiation & Messaging  
Howdy’s messaging stresses a **full-service, high-quality alternative** to both freelance marketplaces and traditional outsourcing. Key differentiation points appear consistently in their marketing: 

- **Top 1% Talent** – They claim to offer access to “LatAm’s top 1% of tech professionals” through rigorous sourcing and vetting ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=,provides%20structured%2C%20ongoing%20mentorship%20to)). Fewer than 5% of applicants make it through their screening, underscoring a elite talent pool ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=match%20at%20L643%20marketplaces%20to,in)). This “world-class talent” angle is akin to Toptal’s “top 3%” messaging, positioning Howdy as a quality-first platform. 

- **Timezone Alignment & Real Team Integration** – Unlike offshore vendors, Howdy emphasizes that nearshore engineers work the same hours as the U.S. team, enabling daily standups and real-time Agile collaboration ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=The%20greatest%20operational%20advantage%20of,driver%20of%20productivity%20and%20agility)). Marketing copy notes *“LatAm-based engineers work when you work”* and *“function as true team members, not siloed resources”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=The%20greatest%20operational%20advantage%20of,driver%20of%20productivity%20and%20agility)). This messaging taps into buyers’ desire for remote hires who can integrate seamlessly into their existing engineering culture. 

- **Retention and Talent Happiness** – A standout differentiator is Howdy’s **98% retention rate** for developers placed with clients ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=vetting%2C%20and%20building%20our%20talent,term%20career%20development)). They frame this as *“industry-leading”* and back it with concrete measures: every Howdy engineer gets premium benefits (health insurance, gym, top-notch equipment) and even the option to work from local “Howdy Houses” (shared offices in major LatAm cities) to reduce isolation ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=their%20tech%20outpost%20in%20Latin,A%20office%20spaces.%20Your)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20reports%20a%2098,attend%20events%2C%20and%20access%20support)). The message “**loyal team members**” is reinforced by testimonials, ex. a client leader noting Howdy engineers bring a *“web of interconnectivity”* across teams ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20is%20frequently%20positioned%20as,onboarding%2C%20and%20strong%20team%20integration)). By solving churn and engagement, Howdy differentiates from gig marketplaces where attrition is high. 

- **Compliance & HR Made Easy** – Howdy explicitly markets *“no HR headaches”* and handles all the red tape of international hiring. They serve as the Employer-of-Record, managing **payroll, taxes, benefits, and labor law compliance** in each country ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=development.%20%2A%20On,workshops%2C%20and%20other%20engaging%20events)). Their content on “Legal and Compliance Headaches You’ll Avoid with Howdy” underlines how they make nearshoring *“a breeze”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/all-the-legal-and-compliance-headaches-you-ll-avoid-with-howdy#:~:text=Keeping%20track%20of%20international%20laws,Howdy%20makes%20nearshoring%20a%20breeze)). This assures clients that they won’t face surprises managing intl. contractors – a pain point Howdy uses to its advantage. 

- **All-Inclusive Pricing & Cost Savings** – Messaging around pricing is direct and transparent. Howdy quotes **all-in monthly rates** (e.g. $6K–$11K for a senior developer, which *includes* salary, taxes, benefits, equipment, and Howdy’s fee) ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=engineering%20outpost%20in%20Latin%20America,space%2C%20Howdy%20fee%20%26%20more)). By bundling costs, they make it simple for clients to understand the budget and emphasize there are *“no hidden costs”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=Why%20should%20I%20hire%20through,Howdy)). They also highlight that U.S. companies can **scale teams 2–3× faster for the same budget** by hiring in LatAm ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=While%20cost%20savings%20are%20real%2C,without%20sacrificing%20quality%20or%20communication)). This cost/value messaging is carefully balanced: *“While cost savings are real, the story is about value – elite engineers at a sustainable cost without sacrificing quality”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=While%20cost%20savings%20are%20real%2C,without%20sacrificing%20quality%20or%20communication)). The upshot is Howdy promises Silicon Valley-caliber talent at a fraction of U.S. cost, with complete operational support included. 

Overall, Howdy’s differentiated message is: *“Like full-time U.S. employees, without the headaches.”* They combine the **benefits of in-house hiring (integration, quality, loyalty)** with the **benefits of outsourcing (lower cost, handled logistics)**. This clear messaging around time zones, quality vetting, compliance, and cost runs through their website and content. *For other talent platforms, Howdy demonstrates the power of addressing **major client pain points upfront** – e.g. “time overlap,” “legal compliance,” or “talent retention” – and backing up claims with specific metrics (98% retention, etc.) to build credibility.* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=%2A%20Retention,weeks%20from%20kickoff%20to%20start)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Bottom%20line%3F%20Howdy%20is%20a,in%20price))

## Website Conversion (Pricing Signals & Lead Capture)  
Howdy’s website is optimized to convert interested visitors into sales leads with minimal friction. The site’s **headline CTA** invites action: *“Confidently hire the world’s best engineers.”* Prominent buttons like **“Hire Now”** or **“Get Connected to LatAm’s Top 1%”** encourage users to start the process ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Hire%20the%20Top%201,Developers%20in%20Latin%20America)). Rather than forcing upfront sign-up payments, Howdy uses a **lead capture form and consultation approach** – clicking “Hire Now” or on a specific candidate likely prompts a contact form or scheduling a call. Notably, the site even teases actual **candidate profiles** (first name, role, skills, experience) to entice clicks. For example, visitors can see a snippet of an **AI Engineer “Javier R.” with 7 years experience** or a **Deep Learning Engineer “Luis F.”**, and if they express interest, the site thanks them and captures their info to follow up ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/#:~:text=Javier%20R)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/#:~:text=Working%20Hours)). This strategy of showcasing talent previews serves as a **qualification flow** – only serious hiring managers will request to “meet” a candidate, at which point Howdy’s team engages them. 

Importantly, Howdy **signals pricing and terms transparently** to build trust. Their YC profile and blog list clear salary ranges (e.g. designers $1.8–4K/mo, engineers $6–11K/mo) ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=engineering%20outpost%20in%20Latin%20America,space%2C%20Howdy%20fee%20%26%20more)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=,2K%20to%20%244K%20per%20month)), and the FAQ states **“no upfront costs – you don’t pay until your first hire starts”** ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=What%20are%20Howdy%27s%20upfront%20costs%3F)). On the site and FAQ they enumerate the zero-risk terms in plain language: *“No startup fees, no recruiting fees, no sourcing fees, no minimums, no long-term contracts, no cancellation fees”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=,Pay%20via%20credit%20card)). Clients pay a **flat weekly rate** for a hired engineer and can scale up or down easily, even **pausing or terminating within the first week at no charge** ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Howdy%20steers%20clear%20of%20long,down%20as%20your%20needs%20change)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=,Provide%20four%20weeks%27%20written%20notice)). By advertising this **contract-free, pay-as-you-go model**, Howdy reduces barriers to conversion – potential customers feel they can “try out” a hire with virtually no risk. This is a powerful offer: for instance, Howdy promises you can start vetting candidates within **24 hours of contacting them**, and if the hire isn’t a fit in the first 7 days, you owe nothing ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=What%27s%20the%20process%20for%20recruiting,and%20timeline%20for%20hiring)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=,Provide%20four%20weeks%27%20written%20notice)). Such guarantees and flexibility (even **weekly credit-card billing** is allowed ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=,Pay%20via%20credit%20card))) are called out on the site to maximize sign-ups. 

Once a lead is captured, Howdy’s **qualification flow** kicks in: A representative will typically consult to “tell us your needs” (step 1), then present candidates, schedule interviews, etc., as outlined in their FAQ ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=1,Get%20to%20work)). This consultative sales approach ensures high-intent leads get white-glove treatment quickly. *The takeaway for other marketplaces is to remove friction on your site – **be upfront about pricing and commitment**, offer a “try before you buy” if possible, and use real examples of talent to entice action. Howdy’s site shows how clarity and risk-reversal (no fees, easy cancellation) can boost conversion of curious visitors into actual customers.* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=Howdy%20allows%20US%20companies%20to,hidden%20costs%2C%20and%20zero%20risk)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Howdy%20steers%20clear%20of%20long,down%20as%20your%20needs%20change))

## Content Marketing (Blogs, Guides & Case Studies)  
Content marketing is a cornerstone of Howdy’s GTM strategy. They run a robust **Howdy.com Editorial Lab** that produces a mix of educational and comparison content tailored to their target audience (CTOs, engineering managers, and HR leads at tech companies) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/experts/howdy-labs#:~:text=,leaders%20scale%20with%20nearshore%20talent)). A few pillars of their content approach:

- **Comparison Guides & “Best of” Lists:** Howdy doesn’t shy away from naming competitors in their content – in fact, they authoritatively rank and compare them. For example, their blog features pieces like **“Top Nearshoring Agencies for LatAm Talent (2026)”** and **“9 Best Companies for Hiring Top Latin American Developers in 2026”**, where Howdy is (unsurprisingly) listed as the top choice ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=1,7.2%20BairesDev)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-developer-staffing-companies-2026#:~:text=9%20Best%20Companies%20for%20Hiring,Latin%20American%20Developers%20in%202026)). These articles objectively outline *pricing, models, pros/cons* of various providers (Andela, BairesDev, Deel, etc.) and then position Howdy’s strengths (e.g. *“retention-led model, all-in pricing, rigorous vetting”*) against them ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Bottom%20line%3F%20Howdy%20is%20a,in%20price)). This tactic captures organic search traffic from potential buyers researching alternatives, while subtly steering readers toward Howdy by the end. It’s a content-driven **“buyer's guide”** that both informs and markets. 

- **Educational Playbooks & Explainers:** Howdy publishes in-depth guides addressing the questions and pain points around global hiring. Examples include articles like **“The Talent Goldmine: Why U.S. Tech Leaders Are Turning to Latin America”** ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=As%20a%20U,right%20skills%20can%20feel%20impossible)), which uses a narrative and data-driven approach to sell the LatAm opportunity, or **“Hiring from Latin America: A Guide to Legal and Compliance Requirements”** ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/hiring-from-latin-america-compliance-guide#:~:text=Hiring%20from%20Latin%20America%3A%20A,technology%20companies%20facing%20a%20domestic)), which tackles the nitty-gritty of taxes, labor laws, and how Howdy handles them. These pieces establish Howdy as a **thought leader and expert resource** in the remote hiring domain. They often include concrete tips, tables (e.g. salary benchmarks ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/2025-latin-america-software-developer-salaries#:~:text=Table%204%20outlines%20verified%202025,for%20global%20pay%20band%20planning))), and step-by-step advice – effectively acting as *free playbooks* for building distributed teams. By freely offering such high-value insights, Howdy attracts decision-makers to their brand and builds trust. 

- **SEO-Focused Content & Keyword Targeting:** Many posts clearly target strategic keywords: “LatAm developer salaries 2025”, “nearshore vs offshore”, “best LatAm staffing firms”, “top nearshore job boards”, etc. For instance, a blog titled **“Best LatAm Staffing Firms in 2026: A Buyer’s Comparison Guide”** directly appeals to anyone searching for staffing options in LatAm ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Compare%20the%20best%20LatAm%20staffing,vs%20Andela%2C%20Deel%2C%20and%20more)). The content is structured with **TL;DRs, quick answers, and FAQ sections** to grab featured snippets and cater to skimmers ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Table%20of%20contents)). This SEO-driven approach has Howdy ranking for numerous relevant queries, bringing in steady organic leads (more in SEO section below). 

- **Customer Success Stories & Case Studies:** Howdy leverages storytelling from its successful clients to provide social proof. On their site’s “Success Stories” section, you’ll find case studies like **Earnest** (a student loans fintech) and **OwnLocal** (digital media) detailing how Howdy helped them *“build a LatAm extension of the team”* and the results achieved ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/case-studies/ownlocal-case-study#:~:text=The%20partner)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/case-studies/earnest#:~:text=15)). These case studies include metrics (e.g. *“15–20% reduction in cost, 20–30% increase in take-home pay for teammates”* in Earnest’s case) and quotes from client executives praising Howdy’s recruiting and cultural fit ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/case-studies/earnest#:~:text=15)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/case-studies/ownlocal-case-study#:~:text=Howdy%20does%20such%20a%20great,right%20fit%20for%20our%20team)). The OwnLocal story mentions Howdy *“found people who are not only smart and hard-working, but the right fit for our team”* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/case-studies/ownlocal-case-study#:~:text=Howdy%20does%20such%20a%20great,right%20fit%20for%20our%20team)). Such real-world examples serve as powerful **bottom-of-funnel content** to convince prospects in similar industries. They show tangible outcomes and lend credibility through recognizable logos. 

- **Thought Leadership & Founder Content:** Beyond the official blog, Howdy’s CEO Jacqueline Samira and other execs contribute content externally. Jacqueline has written advice articles for **Entrepreneur.com** (e.g. cautioning startups about scaling too fast) ([www.entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/author/jacqueline-samira#:~:text=Avoid%20the%20Siren%20Song%20of,Fast%20Can%20Sink%20Your%20Startup)) and appears on podcasts sharing Howdy’s story (like turning $400 in 2020 into a $100M-valued company). This thought leadership content, while not directly about Howdy’s service, elevates the brand’s profile and aligns it with entrepreneurial success and industry leadership. 

Overall, Howdy’s content marketing is **comprehensive and strategic** – covering top-of-funnel educational pieces, middle-of-funnel solution comparisons, and bottom-of-funnel case studies and FAQs. They even leverage data from their operations (such as *verified salary data* or their *98% retention stat*) to create **drama-free, data-backed content** that others in the space might not have. *For other global talent marketplaces, Howdy’s approach is a masterclass in using content to drive growth: invest in quality, evergreen articles that **answer your customers’ questions**, **compare your value to competitors**, and **showcase success stories**. This not only brings in leads organically but also provides rich material for sales to reference.* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=%2A%20Retention,weeks%20from%20kickoff%20to%20start)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20is%20frequently%20positioned%20as,onboarding%2C%20and%20strong%20team%20integration))

## SEO and Organic Acquisition  
Howdy’s strong content engine feeds directly into its SEO strategy. By targeting the right **keyword clusters** and providing authoritative answers, Howdy captures significant organic traffic from companies researching global hiring. Some key aspects of their SEO/organic play:

- **Nearshoring & LatAm Keywords:** Many Howdy articles are clearly optimized for terms like “nearshore software developers”, “Latin America outsourcing”, “hire developers in LatAm”, etc. For example, their piece *“Why U.S. Tech Leaders Are Turning to Latin America”* is essentially an SEO landing page for the concept of *Latin America tech talent advantage* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=As%20a%20U,right%20skills%20can%20feel%20impossible)), and it contains headers like *“The time zone advantage: real-time collaboration”* and *“Favorable economics without compromise”* that align with common search interests (time zone, cost) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=The%20time%20zone%20advantage%3A%20real,collaboration)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/talent-goldmine-latin-america#:~:text=While%20cost%20savings%20are%20real%2C,without%20sacrificing%20quality%20or%20communication)). Similarly, they have a blog on *“Mistakes When Expanding into LatAm Tech Markets”* (targeting those researching expansion pitfalls) and *“Guide to Legal Requirements when Hiring from LatAm”* (targeting compliance queries) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/hiring-from-latin-america-compliance-guide#:~:text=Hiring%20from%20Latin%20America%3A%20A,technology%20companies%20facing%20a%20domestic)). By covering these topics, Howdy positions itself in search results whenever someone is considering nearshoring or hiring in LatAm. 

- **Competitive SEO – Owning “Best X in LatAm” Searches:** Howdy smartly attempts to *own the conversation* around the best solutions in their niche. If a potential customer searches “best Latin America developer staffing companies”, they’ll find Howdy’s blog **“9 Best Companies for Hiring Top Latin American Developers in 2026”** ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-developer-staffing-companies-2026#:~:text=9%20Best%20Companies%20for%20Hiring,Latin%20American%20Developers%20in%202026)). Not only does Howdy’s site then rank for that term, but the content itself subtly markets Howdy as the #1 option. This is an SEO tactic where you rank for comparison queries and gently bias the comparison in your favor. It’s relatively rare in B2B HR tech, so Howdy stands out by doing this. Another example: searching “nearshoring agencies LatAm” surfaces Howdy’s **“Top Nearshoring Agencies (2026)”** post ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=1,7.2%20BairesDev)). In effect, Howdy’s SEO strategy isn’t just capturing generic how-to queries, but also **high-intent commercial queries** (the kind that signal someone is evaluating providers). This likely brings very qualified organic leads to their funnel. 

- **Technical SEO and Content Depth:** Howdy uses **long-form, structured content** with tables of contents, descriptive subheadings, bullet lists, and FAQ sections ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Table%20of%20contents)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Quick%20answer)). This structure helps Google understand and feature their content. For instance, they have TL;DR summaries and “Quick answer” boxes in posts, which often get picked up as featured snippets for search queries ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=,outperforms%20traditional%20LatAm%20staffing%20models)). The depth of their articles (many exceed 2,000+ words) and inclusion of relevant terms (like specific country names, roles, “EOR”, “staff augmentation”) improve their relevance on a wide array of searches. They also interlink their content – blog posts refer to each other and to Howdy’s own services (e.g. linking “vetting” to their vetting process page ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20is%20a%20full,benefits%2C%20and%20ongoing%20retention%20programs)), or linking out to authoritative sources like Harvard or Forbes to boost credibility ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/how-howdy-com-supports-employee-satisfaction-and-sustainability-with-a-network-of-physical#:~:text=Humans%20are%20social%20creatures,Latin%20America%20and%20the%20US))). 

- **Local Language & Talent-Side SEO:** While the primary site (howdy.com) is for clients, Howdy also operates a Spanish-language site (howdylatam.com) focused on Latin American talent (job postings, community events) ([www.howdylatam.com](https://www.howdylatam.com/webinars-y-eventos#:~:text=Howdy%20en%20Posadev%202025)). This helps them appear in local searches for developer jobs and build their talent pipeline. It also boosts their employer brand in-region, making Howdy a known name among developers (which reinforces their ability to source top talent). Hosting webinars and events listing on the LatAm site further drives SEO in that market. For example, “Howdy en Posadev 2025” on their LatAm blog means anyone searching about that conference sees Howdy’s sponsorship ([www.howdylatam.com](https://www.howdylatam.com/webinars-y-eventos#:~:text=Howdy%20en%20Posadev%202025)) – indirectly promoting Howdy to potential talent and even clients reading about the event. 

Through these efforts, Howdy likely enjoys a steady stream of **organic inbound leads** who discover them via Google. Their investment in SEO content means they don’t have to rely purely on paid ads for visibility – they rank for dozens of relevant searches that competitors might have to pay for. *Other global talent marketplaces can take inspiration from this by creating **content that targets the entire consideration cycle** – from general “why hire in X country” education to specific “X vs Y provider” comparisons. By being the one to answer those searches, a company can organically become the trusted choice.* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Remote,than%20Eastern%20Europe%20or%20Asia)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/best-latam-staffing-firms#:~:text=Bottom%20line%3F%20Howdy%20is%20a,in%20price))

## Paid Acquisition (Search, Social & Retargeting)  
In addition to organic reach, Howdy likely leverages targeted paid acquisition across search and social channels to drive growth. While specific ad creatives aren’t publicly visible here, we can infer several tactics from their messaging and typical industry practices:

- **Search Engine Marketing (SEM):** It’s probable that Howdy runs Google Ads against high-intent keywords like “hire Latin American developers,” “nearshore software engineers,” “outsourcing developers U.S. time zone,” etc. When a CTO or recruiter searches those terms, a Howdy ad with copy like *“Hire Top 1% LATAM Developers – No Contracts, 98% Retention”* would be compelling and consistent with their branding ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Hire%20the%20Top%201,Developers%20in%20Latin%20America)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=Why%20should%20I%20hire%20through,Howdy)). Their meta description already reads “Hire the Top 1% of Developers in Latin America. Howdy makes hiring in Latin America simple, scalable, and commitment-free” ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Hire%20the%20Top%201,Developers%20in%20Latin%20America)) – which is essentially ad-ready copy. By bidding on nearshoring-related keywords, Howdy can capture traffic that might otherwise discover competitors or outsourcing agencies. This is especially useful for reaching those who aren’t already aware of Howdy via content. 

- **Paid Social (LinkedIn & Facebook):** Given their B2B tech audience, LinkedIn is a likely channel for Howdy. They could run Sponsored Content ads targeting startup founders, engineering managers, and HR leaders, possibly filtered by company size or industries (e.g. tech companies 50-500 employees in the U.S.). Such ads might promote a whitepaper (“Guide to Hiring in LatAm”) or simply use a testimonial and CTA (“See how Coinbase scaled with LatAm talent”). For instance, a LinkedIn ad might highlight their **98% retention stat or a client quote** to build credibility and prompt a demo request ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20is%20frequently%20positioned%20as,onboarding%2C%20and%20strong%20team%20integration)). On Facebook, Howdy might do **retargeting ads**: anyone who visited Howdy’s site or blog can be shown follow-up ads reminding them of Howdy’s value – “Still looking for engineers? Build your team with vetted LatAm talent. Get resumes in 24h.” The goal is to stay top-of-mind for warm prospects. Facebook/Instagram could also target lookalike audiences of their site visitors or customer list, though LinkedIn likely offers more precision for reaching decision makers. 

- **Ad Creative & Offers:** Howdy’s messaging in ads likely mirrors the site’s no-risk proposition. They could A/B test offers like *“Hire Risk-Free for 1 Week”* or *“No upfront fees – Start Hiring in 24 Hours”* as headlines, since those are strong differentiators ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=Howdy%20steers%20clear%20of%20long,down%20as%20your%20needs%20change)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=What%27s%20the%20process%20for%20recruiting,and%20timeline%20for%20hiring)). Another angle is advertising specific **skill sets** popular in the market: e.g., an ad that says “**Hire AI Engineers in Your Time Zone**” (leveraging the boom in AI talent demand) – notably their LinkedIn tagline mentions “AI Enabled Engineers” which suggests they’re marketing heavily around AI talent now ([uy.linkedin.com](https://uy.linkedin.com/company/howdy#:~:text=Howdy.com%20,com%20enables)). Evidence of this shift is that they list Generative AI Engineers among their available roles on the site and highlight being able to recruit “the best AI-enabled engineers in the Western World” in social bios ([uy.linkedin.com](https://uy.linkedin.com/company/howdy#:~:text=Howdy.com%20,com%20enables)). This kind of targeted copy can attract companies seeking specialized skills. 

- **Ad Library Evidence:** While we don’t have direct screenshots, Howdy’s consistent branding (top 1%, no hidden fees, YC-backed credibility) likely appears across any ad creatives. For instance, Y Combinator’s public post about Howdy’s funding called out *“helping software developers in LatAm get matched with US jobs”* ([py.linkedin.com](https://py.linkedin.com/posts/y-combinator_we-got-an-exclusive-look-at-the-pitch-deck-activity-7019373955757051904-jJSw#:~:text=Howdy%E2%84%A2%20,based%20employers.%20After%20seeing)) – Howdy might use the fact they’re YC W21 and raised $18M as social proof in ads (“YC-funded • $105M valuation • 300 engineers placed”). Some of their content pieces could even be repurposed as promoted posts (e.g., sponsoring the “Best LatAm Staffing Firms” article on LinkedIn to anyone following HR or staffing topics). 

In summary, Howdy likely employs a **multi-channel paid strategy**: **SEM** to capture active searches, **LinkedIn ads** for targeted B2B outreach, and **retargeting** to nurture those who’ve shown interest. They emphasize their unique selling points (time-zone, quality, zero-risk trial) in ad copy to improve click-through and conversion. *Other talent marketplaces can learn from this by aligning their ad messaging tightly with their core value props, and by using specific guarantees or results as hooks. Additionally, leveraging paid ads to amplify successful content (e.g. case studies or guides) can pull prospects into the funnel by offering value first, something Howdy’s extensive content library enables them to do.* ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/faq#:~:text=Howdy%20allows%20US%20companies%20to,hidden%20costs%2C%20and%20zero%20risk)) ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/what-kind-of-commitment-does-howdy-require#:~:text=,Provide%20four%20weeks%27%20written%20notice))

## Partnerships & Network Effects  
Howdy accelerates its growth not just through direct marketing, but via strategic **partnerships and community alliances** that expand its reach:

- **Y Combinator & VC Network:** As a YC W21 startup, Howdy benefited from early access to a network of hundreds of YC companies. They actively highlight that “other YC companies” have hired with Howdy ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=remote%20equipment%20assets%20and%20benefits,Howdy%20is%20deeply%20involved%20in)), leveraging YC’s seal of approval. It’s likely Howdy had a presence in YC’s internal forums or events, offering special attention or deals to fellow alumni. Investors (like Obvious Ventures and Greycroft who led their rounds ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%2C%20Jan,and%20scale%20their%20product))) also often refer portfolio companies to each other – Howdy could be introduced as the go-to hiring solution for startups that those VCs fund. In essence, affiliation with prominent startup programs and VCs has been a trust signal and partnership channel. Other marketplaces often try similar tactics (e.g. partnering with accelerators to offer their services to new startups) – Howdy had a head start by being part of YC and then delivering results for companies in that circle. 

- **Tech Communities & Developer Ecosystem:** On the talent side, Howdy has ingrained itself in Latin American tech communities. They established **“Howdy Houses”** – physical community spaces in cities like Montevideo, Bogotá, Medellín, etc., where they host meetups and invite industry speakers ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=Howdy%20reports%20a%2098,attend%20events%2C%20and%20access%20support)). This community-building fosters goodwill among developers and positions Howdy as more than just a faceless employer; it’s a brand actively supporting local tech scenes. For example, Howdy was a **Diamond sponsor of Posadev 2025** (a major developer conference in Mexico) and even had a Howdy engineer speak on stage about cybersecurity ([www.howdylatam.com](https://www.howdylatam.com/webinars-y-eventos#:~:text=Howdy%20en%20Posadev%202025)). They ran a promotion giving developers free tickets (*“Howdy te lleva a Posadev!”*) to engage the community ([www.howdylatam.com](https://www.howdylatam.com/webinars-y-eventos#:~:text=%C2%A1Howdy%20te%20lleva%20a%20Posadev%21)). These are partnership-like activities with event organizers that raise Howdy’s profile among top engineers (potential candidates) and also demonstrate to clients that Howdy is deeply plugged into talent pools. Additionally, they’ve likely partnered with coding bootcamps or universities in LatAm to source talent early and evangelize their model – though not explicitly stated, it’s a common approach for talent platforms. 

- **Agencies & Referral Partners:** In some cases, Howdy might partner with U.S.-based agencies or consulting firms that lack an offshore hiring arm. For instance, a digital agency that needs extra developers could use Howdy’s talent and infrastructure instead of hiring contractors ad-hoc. By forming referral partnerships (perhaps with a commission or white-label arrangement), Howdy gains access to clients it might not reach directly. Their team even has roles like “Staff Channel Manager” ([wrangler.howdy.com](https://wrangler.howdy.com/#:~:text=Alexander%20W)), which suggests managing channel partnerships could be part of their strategy – whether those channels are recruiting agencies, reseller partners, or platform integrations. It’s plausible that Howdy integrates with hiring platforms (for example, a partnership with an ATS or a freelancing platform to provide premium vetted talent option). 

- **Local Presence & Compliance Partners:** To operate in multiple countries, Howdy either set up its own entities or partnered with Employer-of-Record providers. Interesting, a press release indicates Howdy was *formerly known as Astro* and rebranded ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%2C%20Jan,and%20scale%20their%20product)) – possibly Astro had a partnership model. In scaling, Howdy acquired Brazil-based **GeekHunter in 2023** to expand its network ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/for-ai/best-nearshoring-agencies-latam-talent#:~:text=developers%20can%20collaborate%2C%20attend%20events%2C,and%20access%20support)). An acquisition is an extreme form of partnership (basically bringing a regional recruiting firm in-house to bolster supply). This move gave Howdy deeper roots in Brazil and Spanish-speaking markets quickly. 

- **Accelerators & Incubators:** Beyond YC, Howdy can partner with other accelerators or tech hubs (Capital Factory in Austin, for instance) to become a recommended hiring solution. Being based in Austin, they likely network within that vibrant startup scene. Even non-equity programs and tech associations (like Techstars, local chambers of commerce, etc.) might be channels where Howdy can present or sponsor to reach SMBs and mid-market companies exploring nearshoring. 

In summary, Howdy’s growth is amplified by **network-driven strategies** – from leveraging the YC/VC network for client referrals to embedding in developer communities for talent attraction. Each partnership reinforces their brand: YC and VCs vouch for their credibility, community events vouch for their talent rapport. *Other marketplaces can mirror this by actively engaging the ecosystems on both the demand and supply side – e.g. offer value to startup networks (maybe discounts or dedicated support), collaborate with tech communities in target regions, and even partner with complementary services (like an HR tech platform) to broaden reach. These alliances can create a multiplier effect beyond what direct marketing can do.* ([www.ycombinator.com](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/howdy#:~:text=remote%20equipment%20assets%20and%20benefits,retention%3A%20Developer)) ([www.howdylatam.com](https://www.howdylatam.com/webinars-y-eventos#:~:text=Howdy%20en%20Posadev%202025))

## Social Media & Founder-Led Branding  
Howdy extends its reach and humanizes its brand through active **social media and thought leadership by its founders/executives**. This channel has been key for building trust and awareness:

- **LinkedIn – Company Page and Content Distribution:** Howdy’s LinkedIn company page highlights their mission (“Recruit, Hire, and Retain the Best AI Enabled Engineers in the Western World. YC W21”) and boasts over **20,000 followers** ([do.linkedin.com](https://do.linkedin.com/company/howdy#:~:text=Howdy.com%20%7C%20LinkedIn%20Howdy.com%20,com%20connects)). They regularly post content here, likely sharing their blog articles, industry insights, and company news (e.g. funding announcements or new office openings). Given their rich content library, LinkedIn is a natural distribution channel – for example, a post summarizing their “2026 Cost of Hiring Engineers: US vs. LatAm” report can drive traffic and engagement from HR and tech leaders following the page. Howdy’s team might also post short videos or infographics on LinkedIn, since that platform is conducive to B2B engagement.  

- **Founder’s Presence and Storytelling:** CEO Jacqueline Samira’s personal branding is a significant asset. She often posts on LinkedIn, sharing transparent and inspirational stories about the entrepreneurial journey. One notable post she made recounted: *“On April 30, 2020, I had $400 to my name and was about to give birth… All prospects put hiring on hold… And we didn’t [give up]”*, implying how she persevered and led Howdy through the pandemic ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacquelinesamira_on-april-30-2020-i-had-400-to-my-name-activity-7046536578923446272-_QxM#:~:text=comments%20www,All%20customers%20started)). This story (“from $400 to $100M”) garnered considerable attention and positions Samira as a resilient, relatable founder. By being active on social media, she has built a follower base (16K+ followers on LinkedIn as per her profile) and becomes an evangelist for Howdy’s mission. She also introduced a fun cultural element – #HowdyFromAustin – teasing a piece of art installed at their Austin HQ that she hoped would become part of local culture ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacquelinesamira_howdyfromaustin-activity-7338264125547978753-F3zX#:~:text=Jacqueline%20Samira%E2%80%99s%20Post%20Jacqueline%20Samira,spent%20time%20in%20Austin%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve)). These personal touches not only engage the community but also subtly market Howdy as an authentic, driven company. Prospective clients seeing a passionate founder are more likely to trust the business. 

- **Twitter/X and Other Platforms:** Samira and other Howdy execs maintain a presence on Twitter and possibly TikTok. Samira’s Twitter (as revealed via her Linktree) aligns with Howdy’s mission and even mentions interesting personal tidbits (like raising 6 kids while running the company!) ([www.idcrawl.com](https://www.idcrawl.com/jacqueline-samira#:~:text=IDCrawl%20www,%40JacquelineSami9%20Ser)) – this kind of authenticity can attract media and followers. On Twitter, Howdy’s team might share quick hiring tips, remote work insights, or celebrate client wins. Their tone likely stays informative and optimistic, matching the company’s brand voice. The inclusion of TikTok in the founder’s linktree suggests they may experiment with short-form video – possibly showcasing day-in-the-life at Howdy or highlighting their offices and team events in a fun way. While TikTok is not a typical B2B channel, it could be used for employer branding (attracting talent) or just making the brand feel modern and approachable. 

- **YouTube & Webinars:** It’s common for such companies to have a YouTube channel hosting webinar recordings, how-to guides (e.g. a walkthrough of Howdy’s hiring process), or culture videos. If Howdy has done webinars (say, a panel on “Building Remote Teams 101” or a Q&A on hiring in Mexico), those sessions might be uploaded to YouTube for evergreen viewing. Also, the podcast appearances (like the All-In Recruitment podcast with Howdy’s CTO, or the B2B Stars podcast with Samira) can be shared on YouTube or LinkedIn to amplify reach ([www.manatal.com](https://www.manatal.com/blog/ep56-howdy-com-frank-licea#:~:text=match%20at%20L156%20Lydia%3A%20And,advantages%20does%20the%20region%20have)) ([podcasts.apple.com](https://podcasts.apple.com/mx/podcast/how-jacqueline-samira-founder-of-howdy-com-is/id1675416699?i=1000628199454#:~:text=How%20Jacqueline%20Samira%2C%20Founder...%20,Growth%20Podcast%20Reproducir%20In%20this)). 

- **Executive Advocacy:** Beyond Samira, other leaders like CTO Frank Licea contribute to social engagement. Frank’s podcast interviews and possibly posts (technical blogs or LinkedIn articles) reinforce Howdy’s **“developer-first”** philosophy – in one podcast he elaborated on Howdy’s mission to be *“developer-first”* and the advantages of LatAm talent like time zone overlap and face-to-face community for remote devs ([www.manatal.com](https://www.manatal.com/blog/ep56-howdy-com-frank-licea#:~:text=Lydia%3A%20And%20why%20did%20you,advantages%20does%20the%20region%20have)) ([www.manatal.com](https://www.manatal.com/blog/ep56-howdy-com-frank-licea#:~:text=Frank%3A%20I%20think%20the%20most,This)). When multiple team members actively share insights, it multiplies the company’s thought leadership presence. 

In essence, Howdy leverages social media not just for advertising, but for **community building and credibility**. The founder’s voice adds a narrative that people remember, and the constant sharing of valuable content on LinkedIn keeps Howdy in the conversations around remote work and hiring. *Other marketplaces can emulate this by empowering their founders/executives to be vocal on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter – sharing stories, engaging in discussions, and becoming known experts in the field. This kind of personal brand marketing is low-cost but high-impact, as seen by Howdy’s growing follower counts and engagement. Additionally, treating the company LinkedIn page as a content hub (not just a PR feed) can significantly boost organic reach and trust among potential clients.* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacquelinesamira_on-april-30-2020-i-had-400-to-my-name-activity-7046536578923446272-_QxM#:~:text=comments%20www,All%20customers%20started)) ([www.manatal.com](https://www.manatal.com/blog/ep56-howdy-com-frank-licea#:~:text=Frank%3A%20I%20think%20the%20most,This))

## PR & Earned Media  
Howdy has also harnessed traditional PR and earned media coverage to raise its profile. By sharing their milestones and expertise externally, they build credibility through third-party voices:

- **Funding Announcements:** When Howdy raised funding, they made sure the news was amplified. A **Jan 2023 press release** announced their Series A extension of $5M (bringing total Series A to $18M) and highlighted notable metrics: a *“246% YoY revenue increase”* and a post-money valuation of $105M ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=The%20rebrand%20comes%20as%20the,growth%20and%20%24105%20million%20valuation)). The release also noted Howdy’s rebrand (from their former name “Astro” to “Howdy”) and included context on why demand for tech talent persists ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=AUSTIN%2C%20Texas%2C%20Jan,and%20scale%20their%20product)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=Despite%20hiring%20freezes%20and%20layoffs%2C,looking%20for%20staff%20without%20geographical)). This announcement got picked up by startup news outlets like FinSMEs ([www.finsmes.com](https://www.finsmes.com/2023/01/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5m-total-to-18m.html#:~:text=Howdy%20Extends%20Series%20A%20by,based%20hybrid)). By sharing concrete growth figures and backing by known VCs, Howdy’s PR painted it as a rising leader in remote talent – valuable social proof for skeptical potential clients. Even Y Combinator’s official LinkedIn posted about Howdy’s funding, framing the company’s mission to *“help software developers and engineers in Latin America get matched with jobs from US employers”* ([py.linkedin.com](https://py.linkedin.com/posts/y-combinator_we-got-an-exclusive-look-at-the-pitch-deck-activity-7019373955757051904-jJSw#:~:text=Howdy%E2%84%A2%20,based%20employers.%20After%20seeing)). Such coverage not only attracts clients but also helps in recruiting (talent sees a stable, well-funded platform) and partnerships (others want to work with a leader in the space).

- **Media Features & Lists:** Howdy has earned spots on lists like the **Inc. 5000 fastest-growing companies** (they’ve appeared twice according to Entrepreneur.com ([www.entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/author/jacqueline-samira#:~:text=Jacqueline%20Samira%20is%20the%20founder,5000))). Making the Inc. 5000 or similar rankings provides media fodder and badges of honor they can display. Local media in Austin likely covered Howdy’s growth or unique story as well, given Austin’s interest in successful homegrown tech startups. Each piece of media coverage (TechCrunch, if any, or profiles in business journals) extends awareness to audiences the company’s own marketing might not reach. 

- **Guest Articles & Op-eds:** Jacqueline Samira has contributed thought pieces to publications like *Entrepreneur* – e.g., an article about avoiding the pitfalls of scaling too fast ([www.entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/author/jacqueline-samira#:~:text=Avoid%20the%20Siren%20Song%20of,Fast%20Can%20Sink%20Your%20Startup)). In such op-eds, she subtly brings in her perspective from running Howdy, which indirectly boosts Howdy’s reputation as a knowledgeable player. Similarly, if Howdy’s data or experts were cited in industry publications (say an HR magazine quoting Howdy’s retention techniques), that earned media serves as validation. 

- **Podcasts and Webcasts:** We’ve mentioned podcasts in the social section, but it’s worth noting as PR: Howdy’s leaders have been guests on industry podcasts (like **Manatal’s All-In Recruitment Podcast** and the **B2B Stars podcast**) ([www.manatal.com](https://www.manatal.com/blog/ep56-howdy-com-frank-licea#:~:text=match%20at%20L156%20Lydia%3A%20And,advantages%20does%20the%20region%20have)) ([podcasts.apple.com](https://podcasts.apple.com/mx/podcast/how-jacqueline-samira-founder-of-howdy-com-is/id1675416699?i=1000628199454#:~:text=How%20Jacqueline%20Samira%2C%20Founder...%20,Growth%20Podcast%20Reproducir%20In%20this)). In these interviews they discuss trends in tech hiring, Howdy’s approach, and success stories. This is essentially free publicity to a targeted audience of HR and tech folks. Likewise, Samira’s guest appearance on shows discussing her journey (the “$400 to $100M” story on *The Thought Leader Revolution* podcast) frames her as an inspiring founder, which shines a positive light on Howdy and gets potential clients interested in the company behind the story. 

- **Awards and Recognition:** Any awards (e.g., “Best Places to Work” for their region, or HR tech awards) would also fall under earned media. While we don’t have specifics, if Howdy received accolades, they would use press releases or social posts to spread the word. Even being a **YC alum** is a form of earned credential that Howdy leverages in communications (displaying “YC W21” in bios and profiles) ([uy.linkedin.com](https://uy.linkedin.com/company/howdy#:~:text=Howdy.com%20,com%20enables)). 

Overall, Howdy’s PR strategy capitalizes on **narrative and numbers**: telling a compelling growth story and establishing the founder as an industry voice. By mixing hard metrics (funding, growth, client count) with human interest (startup struggle and mission), they’ve attracted media coverage that validates their market position. *For other global marketplaces, this underlines the importance of engaging in PR: share your successes widely, pitch your unique story to publications/podcasts, and use those earned media pieces in your marketing. Clients often trust media mentions – for instance, a prospect seeing Howdy referenced in Forbes or TechCrunch might be more inclined to reach out.* Additionally, participating in discussions beyond your own blog (as Howdy’s team does) helps shape the industry narrative in your favor. ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howdy-extends-series-a-by-5-million-bringing-total-to-18-million-following-a-full-rebrand-301717111.html#:~:text=The%20rebrand%20comes%20as%20the,growth%20and%20%24105%20million%20valuation)) ([www.entrepreneur.com](https://www.entrepreneur.com/author/jacqueline-samira#:~:text=Jacqueline%20Samira%20is%20the%20founder,5000))

## Events & Community Building  
Real-world events and community initiatives play a significant role in Howdy’s marketing, as they help **create a human connection** in what could otherwise be a faceless remote hiring process. Howdy’s tactics on this front include:

- **Hosting Webinars & Virtual Events:** Howdy has the expertise to host webinars on topics like “How to Onboard Remote Engineers in LatAm” or “Hiring Across Borders: Legal 101”. While we don’t have a specific webinar cited, their detailed blog content (e.g. compliance guides, expansion pitfalls) could easily be repurposed into webinar presentations ([www.howdy.com](https://www.howdy.com/blog/hiring-from-latin-america-compliance-guide#:~:text=Hiring%20from%20Latin%20America%3A%20A,technology%20companies%20facing%20a%20domestic)). Offering live webinars or AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions gives potential clients a chance to learn and interact with Howdy’s team. This not only generates leads (attendees who sign up) but also cements Howdy’s image as *the* knowledgeable partner in nearshoring. It’s common for companies like Howdy to co-host webinars with partners too – for example, a joint webinar with a VC firm or a tech community on scaling engineering teams, where Howdy provides the hiring angle. After the event, they can share the recording (for continued content value on YouTube or the blog).  

- **Conferences & Trade Shows:** On the client side
