# Oceans’ Go-to-Market & Marketing Strategy Breakdown

**Oceans** is a bootstrapped executive assistant (EA) outsourcing service founded in 2021 by Ian Myers, now at ~$15M annual recurring revenue. They connect highly skilled talent from *Sri Lanka* (and now *South Africa*) with U.S. startups and businesses. Below is a channel-by-channel analysis of Oceans’ current marketing and growth strategies, with examples and an effectiveness assessment for each.

## Content Marketing Strategies 🌐

Oceans has recently invested in content marketing to educate potential customers and build credibility. In late 2025, they launched an “**Oceans Blog**” featuring in-depth guides, how-tos, and thought leadership pieces on hiring and managing remote assistants. For example, they published articles like *“How Much Does a Virtual Assistant Cost? | 2026 Pricing Breakdown”* and *“Executive Assistant Job Description: Key Skills, Duties, and Expectations,”* targeting common questions from executives ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020258%20minHow%20Much,Evan%20Walther)) ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020256%20minExecutive%20Assistant,Evan%20Walther)). These posts (authored by team members like Evan Walther and even Ian Myers himself ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/category/hiring#:~:text=WorkflowPublishedOctober%2027%2C%2020257%20minExecutive%20Assistant,How%20are%20they%20different%3FIan%20Myers))) cover practical topics such as what tasks to delegate to a VA, how to onboard an EA, EA vs. VA differences, and performance review tips. The content is **actionable** and SEO-optimized – for instance, *“Should I hire an executive assistant? The ultimate decision guide”* was published to capture search intent around that very question ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020257%20minAccounting%20Virtual,Evan%20Walther)).

Beyond the blog, Oceans produces resources that double as marketing collateral. They have **guides and templates** embedded in blog posts (e.g. onboarding checklists, KPI frameworks for EAs ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog/tasks-to-outsource-to-a-virtual-assistant#:~:text=What%20is%20proper%20integration%3A%20clear,first%2030%20days%20of%20onboarding))). Case studies are not overt on their site, but they highlight success stories through content – such as mentioning clients like Morning Brew and True Classic as fast-growing companies using Oceans assistants ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=amongst%20their%20networks%20,biggest%20growth%20channel%20today)). Oceans also repurposes content on professional networks (e.g. LinkedIn articles and posts) to extend reach.

**Investment & Effectiveness:** Oceans’ content marketing ramped up about 3 years into the business, indicating a deliberate investment in inbound marketing once the company had traction. They likely employ at least one content marketer/copywriter (given the multiple posts published on the same dates) and subject matter contributions from leadership (Ian authored at least one guide ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/category/hiring#:~:text=WorkflowPublishedOctober%2027%2C%2020257%20minExecutive%20Assistant,How%20are%20they%20different%3FIan%20Myers))). This investment is moderate – perhaps a few thousand dollars per month in writing and SEO – but important for long-term *organic lead generation*. It’s early to gauge full ROI, but the content is positioned to capture high-intent organic traffic (e.g. anyone Googling EA hiring costs or VA duties). The blog also reinforces expertise, helping convert wary prospects. Overall, Oceans’ content marketing is **growing in importance**: it adds a scalable lead channel on top of their referral engine. Given that historically Oceans grew without content, this new content strategy likely complements their word-of-mouth rather than drives the majority of leads (for now). Over time, as these guides rank on Google and circulate on social, the **effectiveness should increase** – already the site is becoming visible in searches for offshore executive assistants (an Oceans article appears on page one for related queries) ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog/outsource-executive-assistant#:~:text=Outsource%20Executive%20Assistant%3A%20Simplify%20your,it%E2%80%99s%20that%20too%20much%20of)) ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog/outsource-executive-assistant#:~:text=everything%20runs%20on%20cue)).

## Paid Acquisition Channels 🎯

**Paid advertising has not been a major driver** for Oceans to date. The company’s first few years of growth came *“without any paid marketing”* spend – they reached $10M revenue entirely organically ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20What%20followed,in%20funding%2C%20complex%20strategies%2C%20or)). Ian Myers intentionally avoided costly ad campaigns early on, focusing on referrals and direct sales. This frugality aligns with Oceans being bootstrapped; every customer gained had to come through product quality and network, not ad budget.

Only recently, as Oceans scales beyond its initial network, are they likely *experimenting with paid channels*. Potential paid channels include:

- **Google Search Ads:** Oceans could bid on keywords like “hire executive assistant” or “virtual assistant services for founders.” Competitors in offshoring (Offshore Genius, Staff Domain, etc.) run search ads for these terms, so Oceans may test this to capture active buyers. If you search generic terms, you’ll find other providers, but Oceans’ strong SEO may allow them to rely less on bidding. There’s no clear evidence of aggressive Google Ads from Oceans yet; their site ranks organically for many EA/VA queries, reducing urgent need for paid search.

- **LinkedIn Ads:** Given their B2B target (startup founders, CEOs, operators), Oceans might use LinkedIn Sponsored Content to reach decision-makers. For instance, a sponsored LinkedIn post promoting an e-book (“30 Tasks Founders Should Delegate Today”) or a customer testimonial video could resonate. Any such campaigns would likely be tightly targeted (e.g. founders at tech startups, SaaS CEOs). If used, these are probably **limited-budget, experimental campaigns** to supplement organic social presence.

- **Facebook/Instagram Ads:** Less crucial in this niche, but Oceans might employ retargeting on Facebook/IG for anyone who visited their site. A retargeting ad could show an Oceans value prop (“Get a world-class EA for a fraction of the cost – see how Oceans can help”). This would keep Oceans top-of-mind for warm prospects. We haven’t seen Oceans widely on these platforms, suggesting any spend here is minimal.

- **Display/Retargeting:** Oceans likely uses tracking pixels (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel) on their site to run retargeting ads across the web. Someone who reads a blog post might later see a banner ad (“Free up your time with an Oceans EA+”). This kind of low-cost retargeting is common and would be a sensible **small investment** for Oceans to recapture interested leads. 

Overall, Oceans’ paid acquisition spend appears **modest** relative to their revenue. As of now, word-of-mouth and inbound carry the load, so paid campaigns, if any, are just incremental. We can infer that any current paid budget is a **small percentage** of revenue – perhaps used sparingly for specific initiatives (like testing Google Ads on high-intent keywords, or sponsoring a targeted newsletter). Oceans did sponsor at least one newsletter: *Money Making Story* featured Ian’s journey in a piece “in partnership” with Oceans ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=Built%20a%20%2410M%20Business%20Accidentally%3A,a%20wildly%20profitable%20%2410M%20company)), indicating a paid content placement to reach that audience of entrepreneurs. 

**Effectiveness:** Given Oceans scaled to $2M ARR in 7 months with *$0* ad spend ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=EA%2B%20training%20designed%20to%20upskill,ready%20them%20for%20the%20job)), their customer acquisition cost via organic/referral is outstandingly low. Paid channels thus far likely have **low marginal impact**; Oceans’ growth engine hasn’t depended on them. Any recent wins from paid ads are not publicly known, suggesting limited scale. However, if and when Oceans pours more into paid acquisition, the impact could grow. For instance, a well-run Google Ads campaign could snag those searching for alternatives to hiring a local EA. In summary, paid acquisition is currently a **supplementary channel** – Oceans hasn’t needed to spend big here, and their effectiveness in paid remains to be proven. Most signs point to organic channels being far more effective so far.

## SEO and Organic Strategies 📈

Organic growth is at the heart of Oceans’ strategy. Since inception, **SEO and word-of-mouth referrals** have driven the business (with referrals being the largest contributor, as detailed later). On the SEO front, Oceans is now actively optimizing its online presence to capture relevant search traffic:

- **Keyword Targeting & Content Clusters:** Oceans’ content marketing doubles as their SEO strategy. They have created clusters of content around keywords their target customers search. These include queries like *“how much does a virtual assistant cost,”* *“executive assistant job description,”* *“virtual assistant vs executive assistant,”* and *“should I hire an EA?”*—all topics they’ve covered in blog articles ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020258%20minHow%20Much,Evan%20Walther)) ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020257%20minAccounting%20Virtual,Evan%20Walther)). Each piece is rich with keywords and structured with headings, bullet points, and FAQs to rank well on Google. For example, their *Executive Assistant Job Description* guide explicitly lists key skills and duties of an EA ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog#:~:text=PublishedDecember%2016%2C%2020256%20minExecutive%20Assistant,Evan%20Walther)), likely aiming to rank when a founder Google’s “Executive Assistant job description template.” Similarly, the *VA Cost 2026* post targets “virtual assistant cost” searches, providing a breakdown of rates and pricing models. By building a library of these niche articles, Oceans is creating an SEO **content funnel** that attracts potential clients during their research phase.

- **On-Page/Technical SEO:** Oceans’ website (oceansxyz.com / oceanstalent.com) appears well-structured and fast (it’s built on Webflow’s CMS, which is generally SEO-friendly). Pages have descriptive titles (e.g. “Hire an Executive Assistant for Founders | Oceans Talent” ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/talents/executive-assistants#:~:text=Hire%20an%20Executive%20Assistant%20Built,for%20Founders%20and%20Business%20Leaders))) and clean URLs (e.g. `/blog/how-to-hire-an-executive-assistant`). They interlink relevant content – for instance, a blog about outsourcing tasks might link to their “Hire an EA” landing page or to an EA+ program page. This helps search engines understand their site and pass authority between pages. There’s evidence Oceans has multiple dedicated landing pages targeting organic keywords, such as an *“Outsource Executive Assistant”* page with a thorough explanation of benefits ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog/outsource-executive-assistant#:~:text=Outsource%20Executive%20Assistant%3A%20Simplify%20your,it%E2%80%99s%20that%20too%20much%20of)). Such pages likely serve both SEO (ranking for “outsourced executive assistant”) and conversion (prompting readers to “Get Started” with Oceans).

- **Backlinks & Authority:** As a bootstrapped company without massive PR, Oceans has grown authority by leveraging content and relationships. Their proactive media engagements (podcasts, interviews) often result in links or mentions. For example, the *Fuel Finance* blog profiled Oceans’ success, which not only is PR but provides a quality backlink ([fuelfinance.me](https://fuelfinance.me/case-studies/oceans-journey-with-fuel#:~:text=From%20%E2%80%9CChief%20Everything%20Officer%E2%80%9D%20to,%E2%80%94%20one%20that%E2%80%99s%20gone%20from)). Similarly, features on sites like EconomyNext and Echelon (business publications in Sri Lanka) mention Oceans – these could contribute SEO value while boosting credibility ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=While%20still%20in%20its%20early,transform%20the%20global%20workforce%20landscape)). Oceans likely also gets organic links from satisfied customers’ blogs or social posts (e.g. if a VC investor or startup CEO writes about productivity and cites hiring an Oceans EA).

- **Local SEO (Talent side):** It’s worth noting Oceans also markets to talent (candidates) in Sri Lanka/South Africa. Their careers page and content like “10x your career with Oceans” ([www.oceansxyzsl.com](https://www.oceansxyzsl.com/#:~:text=10x%20your%20career%20with%20Oceans,We%20match)) suggest they optimize for terms that local professionals might search (e.g. “remote executive assistant jobs Sri Lanka”). While this doesn’t directly bring clients, it ensures Oceans can continually attract top applicants, which affects service quality (and thus indirectly client satisfaction).

**Effectiveness:** Oceans’ organic strategy has been **highly effective**. In fact, until recently *all* growth was organic – through SEO content and especially word-of-mouth. As of the first 7 months, Oceans reached $2M ARR purely on organic referrals, *“not a cent spent on advertising”* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=EA%2B%20training%20designed%20to%20upskill,ready%20them%20for%20the%20job)). This underscores how potent their organic channels have been. Now that they’ve built an SEO-optimized content hub, they are positioned to capture even more inbound leads without paying for clicks. We’re already seeing Oceans pages rank on Google for relevant searches (their site appears for queries about offshore executive assistants) ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/blog/outsource-executive-assistant#:~:text=Outsource%20Executive%20Assistant%3A%20Simplify%20your,it%E2%80%99s%20that%20too%20much%20of)). It will likely take a few months for all new content to climb the rankings, but given the quality and relevance, Oceans should gradually gain a steady stream of traffic. The **word-of-mouth/referral element** of organic growth remains extremely strong (discussed later) – that virality combined with solid SEO is a powerful mix. In summary, Oceans’ organic approach is *cost-efficient and high-impact*, providing sustainable growth with minimal marketing spend. The challenge will be to maintain content quality and SEO performance as competition for similar keywords heats up (many VA companies also publish cost and hiring guides). So far, Oceans is on the right track to dominate the *“remote executive assistant”* niche in organic search results.

## Partnerships and Affiliate Programs 🤝

Oceans has employed some creative partnership strategies rather than traditional affiliate marketing. Notably, they **leveraged their cap table and network as a distribution channel** – essentially turning investors and friends into brand ambassadors:

- **Strategic Angels & Advisors:** In its early growth, Oceans actually raised a small $200k round (despite being “bootstrapped” in the sense of no institutional VC). This raise wasn’t about cash for operations, but about forging partnerships: Ian Myers brought in select individuals who could provide *validation and distribution* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=So%20to%20solve%20this%2C%20Oceans,could%20provide%20validation%20and%2For%20distribution)). These included prominent figures in the crypto and venture communities, an NFL player, and entrepreneurs like Austin (likely Austin Rief of Morning Brew) – people with large followings or high credibility. This unique tactic gave Oceans an “unfair advantage in social reach” for things like hiring and content promotion ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=So%20to%20solve%20this%2C%20Oceans,could%20provide%20validation%20and%2For%20distribution)). Essentially, Oceans built a cap table full of influencers who could publicly vouch for the service. When these respected figures say “I work with Oceans and they’re great,” it lends huge credibility and brings in referrals ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Austin%20gives%20Oceans%20an%20unfair,case%20studies%2C%20and%20content%20distribution)). This *partner/investor referral program* was an innovative growth lever that cost Oceans equity rather than ongoing marketing dollars. It appears highly effective: having Morning Brew’s cofounder as an advocate, for example, likely opened doors to other tech founders (Morning Brew itself became a client).

- **Agency & B2B Partnerships:** Oceans positions itself as a talent provider for startups and possibly partner agencies. While we haven’t seen a formal affiliate program advertised (no “Refer a client, get X% off” on their site), it’s likely Oceans informally partners with startup incubators, VC firms, and service providers. For instance, a fractional CFO firm or a venture fund’s portfolio success team might recommend Oceans to companies that need operational support. Oceans’ meteoric rise and reputation make it an attractive partner; any agency whose clients struggle to hire affordable EAs could refer them to Oceans (possibly in exchange for a referral fee or just goodwill). We don’t have public data on commissions, but given their reliance on referrals, Oceans may reward *word-of-mouth evangelists* in subtle ways (exclusive deals, shout-outs, etc.). 

- **Integration Partnerships:** Oceans is a services business, so typical product integrations don’t apply. However, they do integrate into clients’ workflows seamlessly, which is part of their pitch (e.g. their EAs work with whatever tools the client uses). In marketing, they emphasize being a plug-and-play team member rather than an outsourced “other.” While not an integration in the software sense, this *embedded approach* acts as a selling point that differentiates them from gig VA platforms.

- **Affiliate/Referral Program:** There’s no public affiliate signup for Oceans (unlike, say, SaaS companies that give referral links). Instead, Oceans’ “affiliate program” is essentially the *natural referral loop* of happy customers bringing in peers. Ian Myers noted that *“if [Oceans] worked so well for you, you naturally recommend they go straight to Oceans”*, which creates a viral referral loop ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L350%20course%2C%20because,they%20go%20straight%20to%20Oceans)). This suggests that rather than paying per referral, Oceans relies on **customer advocacy** (more on this in the referrals section) – though they might privately arrange referral bonuses for partners who send big business their way. For example, an agency that sends five clients might get a discount on their own Oceans service or some other perk.

**Effectiveness:** Oceans’ partnership tactics have been **highly effective**, especially the strategic investor/advocate approach. By aligning with well-connected individuals, Oceans tapped into broad networks quickly. This translated into trust and leads at scale that a young company would normally struggle to attain. The fact that big-name startups and mid-market companies signed on (Morning Brew, beehiiv, True Classic, etc.) suggests that these introductions and endorsements worked ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=amongst%20their%20networks%20,biggest%20growth%20channel%20today)). Oceans essentially turned *social capital into customers*. 

Traditional affiliates (paid commissions for referrals) don’t seem to be a major factor – they haven’t needed a formal program since organic referrals are flowing freely. Should growth ever slow, they could introduce a structured referral incentive (e.g. “get X off your invoice for each friend you refer”), but so far the **informal advocacy** is doing the job. Partnerships with organizations (VCs, incubators) likely contribute steadily, though under the radar. For example, if Oceans partners with a startup accelerator to be the “preferred talent provider,” that could consistently funnel new clients. We don’t have specific public examples, but given Oceans’ client list, it’s plausible some came via such channels. 

In summary, Oceans’ growth shows that *relationships trumped formal affiliate marketing*. Their investments – $200k in strategic partnerships and lots of personal relationship-building – have yielded outsized returns in credibility and referrals. It’s a more organic, trust-based model than a typical affiliate program, and it has been extremely effective for their niche.

## Social Media Presence and Tactics 📣

**LinkedIn** is Oceans’ standout social media channel. Both the company page and Ian Myers’ personal profile are very active, leveraging LinkedIn’s professional audience of founders and executives (perfect for an EA service). Key aspects of their social strategy:

- **Company LinkedIn Content:** Oceans’ LinkedIn page has grown a large following – on the order of **tens of thousands of followers** (over 70,000 by late 2025) ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oceanstalent_what-does-it-take-to-scale-a-service-business-activity-7270791625100976128-4KxE#:~:text=insights%20into%20scaling%20a%20service,Matters%3A%20Attracting%20Top%20Talent%20in)) – which is remarkable for a young B2B services company. They achieve this by regularly posting high-value content. For instance, Oceans runs a “Day in the Life” series highlighting their team members (e.g. *“A Day in the Life: Working as a Marketing Operations Specialist at Oceans”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oceanstalent_what-does-it-take-to-scale-a-service-business-activity-7270791625100976128-4KxE#:~:text=insights%20into%20scaling%20a%20service,Matters%3A%20Attracting%20Top%20Talent%20in))). These posts serve dual purposes: marketing to clients (showing the caliber and enthusiasm of Oceans’ talent) and employer branding (attracting more talent by showcasing success stories). They also share thought leadership on topics like *“Why Employer Branding Matters: Attracting Top Talent”* ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oceanstalent_what-does-it-take-to-scale-a-service-business-activity-7270791625100976128-4KxE#:~:text=insights%20into%20scaling%20a%20service,Matters%3A%20Attracting%20Top%20Talent%20in)), indicating they discuss broader remote work, HR, and productivity trends. The company posts likely include client testimonials, milestone celebrations (hitting X ARR or Y employees placed), and media mention shout-outs. By maintaining an active LinkedIn feed, Oceans stays visible to potential clients scrolling their newsfeed and reinforces its industry authority.

- **Ian Myers’ Personal LinkedIn:** Ian uses his personal LinkedIn (“Ian Myers 🌊”) as a key marketing asset. He frequently posts insights about building remote teams, delegation best practices, and lessons from Oceans’ journey. For example, one of his posts from 2 years ago educates about the “talent J-Curve” and common mistakes in building remote teams ([tz.linkedin.com](https://tz.linkedin.com/posts/ian-myers-2a997852_founders-startup-talent-activity-7006264461086892033-Isod#:~:text=Our%20least%20successful%20clients%20have,Curve%20is%20just%20like%20any)). Ian’s posts often get strong engagement because they blend **expertise and narrative** – he’s transparently sharing how Oceans succeeds or how clients can improve their workflows. This content not only drives word-of-mouth (his network sees it and may inquire about Oceans) but also builds his *personal brand as a thought leader* in outsourcing and productivity. With nearly 9,000 followers on his profile and hundreds of posts over the past couple years ([lk.linkedin.com](https://lk.linkedin.com/posts/ian-myers-2a997852_oceans-xyz-activity-7006960855070179330-Z6J4#:~:text=Executive%20Assistants%20,See%20All)), he’s consistently amplifying Oceans’ message. His credibility as a repeat founder and a bootstrap success story also attracts podcast invites and press (which he then shares on LinkedIn, creating a virtuous cycle of PR and social content).

- **Twitter (X):** Oceans’ presence on Twitter is minimal. Ian Myers does not have a large Twitter following (his account has ~119 followers ([twitter.com](https://twitter.com/ian_myers#:~:text=Ian%20Myers%20,2009%20945%20Following%20119%20Followers)) and isn’t actively used for Oceans promotion). This is likely a conscious choice – their target customers and referral sources are more concentrated on LinkedIn and in closed networks rather than the noisy open Twitter environment. Instead of trying to build a Twitter audience from scratch, Ian directed his energy to channels where he already had network traction (LinkedIn, and real-world networks). **Effectiveness on Twitter** is thus negligible; it’s not a focus.

- **Instagram:** Oceans doesn’t heavily target Instagram for client acquisition, but they may use it for *employer branding and culture*. Many companies share team photos, workplace culture, and achievements on Instagram to humanize the brand. Given Oceans employs hundreds of “Divers” (their term for their EA talent) across Sri Lanka and South Africa, an Instagram presence could showcase team meetups, training sessions, or takeovers by EAs showing their workday. This would appeal to potential hires and also subtly assure clients that Oceans has a vibrant, happy workforce. However, any Instagram activity is likely secondary – not a core lead gen channel, since clients are more likely found elsewhere.

- **YouTube & Video Content:** There’s no indication of a big YouTube effort (no widely known Oceans channel). However, Oceans might produce video testimonials or case study clips for use on LinkedIn or their website. They have appeared in video format via podcasts (e.g., a video interview “I Quit My Job & Accidentally Built a $10M Business” circulated online ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=Built%20a%20%2410M%20Business%20Accidentally%3A,a%20wildly%20profitable%20%2410M%20company))). Oceans could repurpose such interviews on YouTube for discoverability (for example, posting Ian’s podcast episodes on a company YouTube playlist). Overall, video is used primarily through other outlets (podcasts, webinars) rather than a dedicated Oceans video channel.

**Effectiveness:** Oceans has been **very effective on LinkedIn**, which serves as both a content marketing and community engagement platform for them. The company page’s follower count (50k+ range) and active engagement suggest that LinkedIn is likely driving both awareness and direct leads. Many prospects might first hear of Oceans via a LinkedIn post that went viral or was shared by a connection. The tone of their LinkedIn content – educational and celebratory rather than salesy – fosters trust. This aligns with Oceans’ word-of-mouth ethos, where customers often come through recommendations (LinkedIn is essentially an online word-of-mouth amplifier for them).

Ian Myers’ personal brand on LinkedIn is a **growth flywheel** of its own. His authenticity and willingness to share advice likely convert readers into customers or at least fans who refer others. In the early days, his personal outreach on LinkedIn or via posts likely landed the *first 20-50 customers*, which he personally onboarded ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=match%20at%20L179%20,term%20success)). That direct, founder-led social touch is invaluable and remains a cornerstone of Oceans’ GTM approach.

For other social channels, the effectiveness is limited. That’s by design – they focus where their audience is. We don’t see evidence of Twitter or Facebook bringing in business, and that probably won’t change unless Oceans broadens to mass-market offerings. In conclusion, **LinkedIn is Oceans’ social media stronghold**, effectively driving engagement, brand building, and even talent recruitment, while other social platforms play only supporting roles.

## PR and Earned Media Approaches 📰

Oceans has punched above its weight in terms of PR and earned media, despite not having raised big VC rounds (which are a typical trigger for press). They’ve smartly leveraged their compelling founder story and unique positioning to get coverage in various outlets:

- **Founder Story Features:** Oceans and Ian Myers have been profiled in entrepreneurial newsletters and blogs. For example, *Sheldon’s Letter* did a deep-dive titled “How Oceans scaled to $15M ARR by solving for talent” ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Well%20this%20week%20is%20extra,ARR%20in%20just%203%20years)) (Feb 2025), which provided behind-the-scenes growth tactics. Similarly, *MoneyMakingStory.com* ran “Built a $10M Business Accidentally: From Finance to Freedom” in Mar 2025 ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Ian%20Myers%20found,cycle%20of%20chasing%20empty%20goals)), telling Ian’s journey and emphasizing how he grew to $10M with $0 marketing spend ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20What%20followed,in%20funding%2C%20complex%20strategies%2C%20or)). These pieces often highlight Oceans’ **unique selling points** – e.g. exceptional offshore talent, a bootstrap mindset, and the power of referrals – effectively turning Oceans’ experience into teachable content. Such features serve as both PR (boosting brand credibility) and content marketing (they often read like case studies or interviews that potential clients find inspiring). Notably, at least one of these was in partnership (suggesting Oceans might have sponsored it to ensure the story reached a wide audience of entrepreneurs).

- **Podcasts and Interviews:** Ian Myers has appeared on several podcasts, which is classic earned media for a founder. On the **Kara Goldin Show (Episode 571)**, he discussed how Oceans is *“transforming the outsourcing industry with ethical practices and significant cost savings,”* focusing on improving conditions for offshore talent ([karagoldin.com](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/ian-myers/#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%20of%20The,AI%2C%20and%20offers%20insights%20on)). This interview likely reached a broad audience of business leaders and emphasized Oceans’ differentiators (ethical outsourcing, global talent sourcing). Ian was also a guest on the **Startup Hustle podcast** (as noted on Oceans’ LinkedIn) to talk about scaling a service business globally ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oceanstalent_what-does-it-take-to-scale-a-service-business-activity-7270791625100976128-4KxE#:~:text=What%20does%20it%20take%20to,Matters%3A%20Attracting%20Top%20Talent%20in)). Additionally, back in late 2022, he did a “Coffee Chat” with the *Young Money* newsletter about “the future of outsourced work” ([www.youngmoney.co](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/coffee-chat-1-ian-myers#:~:text=Coffee%20Chat%20,you%20can%20join%20the%20tens)). Appearing on such platforms gave Oceans exposure to target demographics (startup enthusiasts, business owners) at **no cost** besides Ian’s time. It’s worth noting that these interviews often double as storytelling and subtle promotion – for instance, on podcasts Ian can mention success metrics and client names, which serves as organic advertising.

- **Press in Sri Lanka & Niche Media:** Oceans has received positive coverage in Sri Lankan business media, which underscores their role in the local economy and bolsters their reputation. Publications like *EconomyNext* and *Echelon* ran features in 2024 profiling Oceans’ model. One EconomyNext piece titled *“Empowering Sri Lankan Talent Globally: Oceans’ Vision for the Future of Work”* was an interview with Ian ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=While%20still%20in%20its%20early,transform%20the%20global%20workforce%20landscape)). It highlighted Oceans *“connecting exceptional operational talent in Sri Lanka with global, cutting-edge startups”* and *spotlighting the island’s remarkable workforce* ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=While%20still%20in%20its%20early,transform%20the%20global%20workforce%20landscape)). Another article (*Echelon*, Aug 2024) shed light on Oceans’ *“rapid ascent fueled by an innovative remote working model and core values”*, including quotes from Oceans’ Sri Lanka leadership ([www.echelon.lk](https://www.echelon.lk/oceans-opening-global-opportunities-for-local-professionals/#:~:text=Kanishka%20Perera%2C%20Vice%20President%20of,class%20career%20prospects)). These pieces are semi-PR (possibly brand partnership articles) that serve to strengthen Oceans’ employer brand locally (attracting top Sri Lankan professionals by showcasing a successful home-grown company) and also demonstrate to clients that Oceans is getting recognized for its innovation. 

- **Industry/Earned Media:** Oceans has been included in roundups and blogs by others in the tech ecosystem. For instance, FuelFinance (a startup CFO tool) wrote a case study about Oceans’ journey from “Chief Everything Officer to data-driven leadership” ([fuelfinance.me](https://fuelfinance.me/case-studies/oceans-journey-with-fuel#:~:text=From%20%E2%80%9CChief%20Everything%20Officer%E2%80%9D%20to,%E2%80%94%20one%20that%E2%80%99s%20gone%20from)), which portrayed how Oceans scaled and uses financial tools. Also, Oceans gets organic mentions in lists or posts about virtual assistant companies (e.g., they might be listed among top offshore VA providers on content sites). While they haven’t been on TechCrunch or Forbes yet (likely due to no big funding event), their consistent ARR milestones and unique story could very well land them a feature in a publication like *Forbes* or *HBR* focusing on remote work trends.

**Approach & Messaging:** Across these PR channels, Oceans crafts a narrative of *“exceptional global talent, reimagined outsourcing, and founder-driven success.”* Ian often stresses how no one realized the talent goldmine in Sri Lanka and how harnessing it with a quality-first approach made Oceans skyrocket ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=customers%20,with%20Oceans)). He also emphasizes ethical aspects – e.g. offering full-time employment and growth to offshore staff, rather than gig work, thus *“redefining global talent sourcing”* ([karagoldin.com](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/ian-myers/#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%20of%20The,AI%2C%20and%20offers%20insights%20on)). This resonates with modern audiences who care about fair globalization. 

**Effectiveness:** Oceans’ PR efforts have been **highly effective in building brand credibility**. They have managed to get their name in front of the right audiences without traditional advertising. Every founder reading a case study or listening to a podcast hears “$15M ARR in 3 years, all through great talent and word-of-mouth” – a compelling hook that likely sparks inbound interest (“I want an EA service like that!”). The earned media also bolsters trust: by the time a prospect visits Oceans’ site, they may have already heard Ian on a podcast or read an interview, making them far more likely to convert. 

Quantitatively, it’s hard to measure PR, but qualitatively Oceans is now a known name in certain circles (startup Twitter/LinkedIn, Sri Lankan tech community, newsletter readers). The founder’s willingness to share knowledge has cultivated goodwill; people feel they *know* Oceans before ever speaking to a salesperson. In absence of big-budget ad campaigns, this kind of reputation-centric growth has been invaluable. It likely contributes to why **referrals remain the #1 channel** – the market hears the success story and passes it along. As Oceans continues, maintaining a strong PR presence (perhaps aiming for more U.S. tech press or speaking at industry events about remote work) will further cement their authority. So far, their media strategy has perfectly complemented their referral engine, at virtually no financial cost.

## Sales-Led vs. Product-Led Growth Mix 📊

Oceans operates a **services business**, so the classic definitions of sales-led vs product-led growth need some interpretation. In general, Oceans leans **sales-led** (high-touch, human-driven acquisition) in how it closes new clients, but it heavily relies on what might be called a “product-led” dynamic in how it generates demand (i.e. the service quality creates its own momentum through referrals). Here’s the breakdown:

- **Sales-Led Elements:** Bringing on a new Oceans client typically involves a sales process. Given the ~$3k+ per month price tag for an EA service, most clients will speak to a human (initially Ian himself, now likely a sales team member) before signing up. In Oceans’ early days, this was entirely founder-driven sales: *Ian personally guided the first 20-50 customers*, giving them a white-glove onboarding and ensuring they had an incredible experience ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=match%20at%20L179%20,term%20success)). This hands-on approach is classic sales-led growth; Ian acted as the account executive, solutions consultant, and customer success manager all in one, tailoring the service to each client’s needs. Even now, Oceans’ website encourages leads to “Get Started” or “Book a Call” rather than offering a self-serve checkout – indicating a consultative sales funnel. Once a lead comes in (via referral or content), Oceans likely has a sales rep discuss the client’s needs, propose a tailored solution (e.g. matching with a specific EA), and guide them through onboarding. This *high-touch sales* approach is appropriate because clients are essentially signing up for a long-term staff augmentation, which requires trust and fit assessment (not a commodity swipe purchase). Oceans also employs **account management** (customer success) after the sale – checking in with clients, adjusting to their evolving needs, which is part of a sales-led retention strategy.

- **Product(Service)-Led Elements:** Oceans may not have a software “product” to drive viral adoption, but the **service quality itself functions as the growth engine**. In a product-led growth (PLG) model, an excellent product gets users to spread it and adopt it without heavy sales push. Oceans mirrors this: by delivering exceptional assistants and service, they turned customers into evangelists. They hit $2M ARR in months purely because the service was so good that *“customers loved the service and shared it amongst their networks”* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=EA%2B%20training%20designed%20to%20upskill,ready%20them%20for%20the%20job)). This is essentially *product-led referral*. Oceans’ leadership explicitly recognizes this dynamic: *“Like with product building, the best form of marketing is great work.”* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Underpinning%20this%20customer%20flywheel%20is,good%20at%20what%20you%20do)). In other words, by exceeding expectations (the “product” being a highly skilled, reliable EA embedded in a client’s team), they ensure clients stick around (low churn) and recommend Oceans to peers (organic expansion). This has created **natural virality** much like a PLG software tool that spreads team to team – except here it’s CEO to CEO recommending Oceans. Additionally, Oceans initially focused on a single “product offering” (EA+ service for founders) that was tightly defined and excellent. This focus (analogous to nailing a core product before expanding) helped them get a toehold. Only after proving the EA service did they add other roles (finance, marketing, ops support), in a controlled, product-led way by reusing the same high-quality talent processes.

- **Mix and Evolution:** In practice, Oceans uses a hybrid approach: *sales-led acquisition, product-led retention/expansion*. Early growth was basically **founder-led sales** turbocharged by product-led viral loops. As the company scales, Ian has likely hired sales and client success reps to handle the growing client base (so he can focus on strategy). There is also an element of **community-led growth** via the founder’s presence in networks (which bridges into product-led, since the community buzz comes from happy users). Oceans has not taken a strictly PLG route like a SaaS that offers a free trial or self-serve tier – that wouldn’t fit a service requiring human matchmaking. Instead, they’ve smartly used *service excellence as their “free trial.”* For instance, a founder’s friend would rave, “My Oceans EA changed my life,” which prompts the founder to try it (almost like getting a free testimonial-based trial in their mind).

**Effectiveness:** This blended strategy has worked extremely well. The sales-led aspects ensured that prospects were converted with care and the right expectations (critical for a service, so that the first match is successful – Oceans boasts an 86% first-match success rate ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=1500))). The product-led aspects ensured once converted, customers stayed and brought others. The **low churn and high referral rate** are evidence that the “product” is delivering. If Oceans had attempted pure product-led (say a self-serve VA marketplace), they likely would not have seen such rapid trust and adoption, because a large part of their value is vetting and matching (which benefits from the human sales touch). Conversely, if they did pure sales-led without an outstanding service, they could have grown initial revenue but might have fizzled out from churn or high CAC. By marrying the two, they created a sustainable growth loop.

In summary, Oceans’ growth model is **sales-assisted and service-led**. The founder’s personal selling was crucial in the beginning, but it was the *service quality (product)* that drove word-of-mouth to fill the top of funnel. As they scale, we can expect them to remain sales-led in process (especially for mid-market clients they’re now targeting), while still depending on the “wow factor” of their service to fuel referrals. This mix has been highly effective – evidenced by reaching 250+ clients and $15M ARR in 3 years with minimal traditional marketing spend ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Within%207%20months%2C%20Oceans%20was,Oceans%E2%80%99%20biggest%20growth%20channel%20today)).

## Community Building Efforts 👥

Oceans does not appear to run a traditional “community” (no public user forum or community Slack for clients, as one might see with a SaaS platform). However, community in a broader sense – **networking, events, and group engagement** – has played a role in their GTM:

- **Founder Networks & Online Communities:** Ian Myers tapped into the startup founder community heavily. Early on, many Oceans clients came from Ian’s personal network of founders ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L277%20Like%20most,With%20a%20key%20difference)). That network was essentially a community – likely forged through previous startup experience, accelerators, or LinkedIn groups. By solving a common problem among his peers (needing affordable, high-caliber assistants), Ian turned that informal community into a growth channel. He also participates in online communities: for example, he’s been featured in **newsletter communities** (e.g. Young Money by Jack Raines, which has a community of finance/startup enthusiasts) ([www.youngmoney.co](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/coffee-chat-1-ian-myers#:~:text=Coffee%20Chat%20,you%20can%20join%20the%20tens)). Whenever he shares insights or Oceans’ story in these forums, it builds a form of community rapport – readers often discuss and share these stories. While not a community he owns, he’s leveraging existing ones (Twitter threads, Hacker News discussions when his story was shared, etc.) to build interest.

- **Events & Webinars:** There’s no public record of Oceans hosting large events or webinars for marketing. They haven’t needed to do broad webinars like “How to Delegate Effectively – presented by Oceans” yet, possibly because demand is strong without it. However, it’s possible they have participated in events run by others. For example, **Startup accelerator demo days or HR tech meetups** – Oceans might speak or sponsor to get in front of an audience of growing companies. In Sri Lanka, Oceans likely engages in local tech events or university career fairs to build their talent pipeline (their staff have spoken about Oceans’ mission in local press ([www.echelon.lk](https://www.echelon.lk/oceans-opening-global-opportunities-for-local-professionals/#:~:text=Kanishka%20Perera%2C%20Vice%20President%20of,class%20career%20prospects)), which often ties into event appearances). Internally, they might run webinars or training sessions for clients (teaching execs how to work best with remote EAs) – which doubles as a value-add service and subtle marketing (clients who attend might invite a friend from another company, spreading awareness).

- **Client Community:** Oceans could benefit from connecting its clients to each other (many are startup founders who might enjoy sharing productivity tips). While we haven’t seen a formal community platform for Oceans clients, they might foster community spirit through *exclusive events or groups*. For instance, they could host a virtual roundtable for all CEOs who use Oceans to discuss delegation strategies. If they’ve done so, it hasn’t been publicly promoted, probably kept intimate. Such efforts encourage clients to talk about their Oceans experience with peers, again fueling referrals.

- **Talent Community:** On the talent side, Oceans definitely invests in community. They have an internal community of “Divers” (their term for their assistants) – likely via Slack or Workplace where EAs across Sri Lanka and South Africa share knowledge and socialize. They’ve branded their talent network as something aspirational (“Become an Oceans Diver” is on their career page) ([www.oceansxyzsl.com](https://www.oceansxyzsl.com/#:~:text=10x%20your%20career%20with%20Oceans,We%20match)). They also highlight culture: posts about *employee experiences, growth stories, and Oceans team values* appear on LinkedIn ([www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oceanstalent_what-does-it-take-to-scale-a-service-business-activity-7270791625100976128-4KxE#:~:text=insights%20into%20scaling%20a%20service,Matters%3A%20Attracting%20Top%20Talent%20in)). This signals a strong internal community. While this is not outward marketing, it directly affects service quality and retention (happy EAs = happy clients), and indirectly, clients see that Oceans cares about its people, which is a selling point. Oceans’ **EA+ training program** is also a community effort – cohorts of new EAs train together, forming bonds and a sense of belonging to the “Oceans family.”

**Effectiveness:** Community building at Oceans is more subtle but **important for long-term success**. The lack of a public-facing client community hasn’t hurt them – their customers get community-like benefits through word-of-mouth networks anyway. If anything, the “community” of Oceans clients exists informally on social media: founders often run in the same circles, and Oceans’ widespread referrals mean many new clients already know an existing Oceans client. This creates a *de facto community of advocates*. 

Internal community among talent has proven effective, too. By empowering and engaging their assistants, Oceans ensures low turnover and high performance. This “community of practice” among EAs leads to continuous improvement and innovation in the service, which clients eventually feel. It’s one reason clients rave about their assistants and refer others. 

While Oceans hasn’t needed a heavy community marketing play (like user conferences or huge webinars) yet, they might consider small-scale exclusive events as they target more mid-market customers. For example, a private dinner or online forum for operations executives who use offshore talent could position Oceans as the convenor of thought leadership. As of now, though, **community efforts are relatively low-cost and organic** – mostly piggybacking on existing networks. This approach fits their lean style, and given the results so far (rapid growth without formal community programs), it’s been sufficient. In summary, Oceans’ community building is *behind-the-scenes effective* – it’s the glue that keeps their network strong – even if it’s not a flashy public strategy.

## Referral Programs and Customer Advocacy 🔄

Referrals are the **lifeblood** of Oceans’ growth. Rather than a structured “give-get” referral program, Oceans has catalyzed *natural customer advocacy* by delivering exceptional service. The result: an overwhelming portion of their new business comes from existing customer referrals and word-of-mouth:

- **Word-of-Mouth as #1 Channel:** Oceans hit $2M ARR within 7 months of launch *purely via word-of-mouth* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=EA%2B%20training%20designed%20to%20upskill,ready%20them%20for%20the%20job)). Early customers were so happy with their EAs that they organically told friends and colleagues. Ian Myers noted that *“Customers loved the service and shared it amongst their networks,”* and to this day **referrals remain Oceans’ biggest growth channel** ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=EA%2B%20training%20designed%20to%20upskill,ready%20them%20for%20the%20job)). This is an almost viral dynamic considering the high contract value – it’s not every day that CEOs proactively recommend their outsourcing provider to others, but Oceans achieved that by surpassing expectations.

- **Enabling Easy Referrals:** Oceans doesn’t just hope for referrals; they cultivate them. Ian’s strategy from day one was to *“empower clients to be the hero”* when they refer ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=Ian%20states%20bluntly,and%20reliable%2C%20referrals%20naturally%20followed)). This means Oceans makes the referring customer look good. For example, if a founder refers Oceans to a fellow founder and that peer ends up with a game-changing assistant, the referrer gains social capital (“Thanks for the awesome tip!”). Oceans facilitates this by consistently delivering quality – ensuring any friend you send will be taken care of. In the early days, Ian personally ensured referred friends got white-glove service so that no one regretted referring ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=match%20at%20L179%20,term%20success)).

- **Referral Loop Mechanics:** There’s a natural virality in Oceans’ model. An oft-mentioned scenario: A founder gets paired with an excellent EA who significantly improves their productivity. When their investor or fellow founder asks, “How are you managing so much?” the founder credits their Oceans EA. That intrigued person then approaches Oceans instead of hiring on their own – *“because Oceans worked so well for you, you recommend they go straight to Oceans”*, creating a self-perpetuating referral loop ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L350%20course%2C%20because,they%20go%20straight%20to%20Oceans)). Another built-in trigger is if someone tries to *poach* an Oceans EA (because they’re so good), Oceans has the structure to say “we can get you a similar EA” – turning a potential churn event into a new client referral (this was hinted as a “natural virality trigger” of focusing on EA+ roles in the same circles ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=%E2%86%BB%20Natural%20virality%20triggers))).

- **Customer Advocacy & Testimonials:** Many Oceans clients have become public advocates. They may post on LinkedIn about their great experience, or allow Oceans to quote them. For example, Oceans can cite companies like True Classic or Beehiiv as happy clients – those brand logos and any accompanying testimonial add social proof to marketing materials. Some high-profile advocates include investors-turned-customers who talk about Oceans on podcasts or Twitter (Austin Rief publicly praising Oceans would carry a lot of weight, for instance). Oceans likely collects NPS scores or ratings (they advertise a 4.7/5 average rating of their talent on the site ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=86))) which indicates strong customer satisfaction – and satisfied customers talk. 

- **Formal Referral Incentives:** While the primary motivator for referrals has been goodwill and service impact, Oceans might also use *informal rewards*. For example, if a client refers multiple friends, Oceans could surprise them with a discount or an upgraded service tier. Even without a published program, they can show appreciation individually (handwritten thank-you, credits, etc.). This personal touch fits Oceans’ relationship-driven approach. So far, there’s no evidence of a public referral bonus scheme, probably because they haven’t needed an extra nudge – clients refer out of genuine enthusiasm.

**Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of referrals for Oceans is **phenomenal**. It’s no exaggeration that referrals built the company to its current scale. By mid-2022, all sales were referral-driven, and by 2023–2024, referrals were still driving the majority of ~30-40 new placements per month ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L57%20Fast%20forward,40%20employees%20per%20month)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L350%20course%2C%20because,they%20go%20straight%20to%20Oceans)). This indicates a high viral coefficient in a traditionally non-viral industry. The *quality of referral leads* is also high – they convert faster and churn less because they come pre-sold by someone they trust. That’s one reason Oceans could grow so fast without churn: referred clients had the right expectations set by their friends, and they experienced the promised value. 

In terms of investment, this channel costs Oceans very little beyond maintaining service excellence. The ROI on referrals is essentially infinite; a referral might cost maybe a thank-you note, versus thousands in ad spend to acquire the same customer cold. Oceans exemplifies how **customer advocacy can be the strongest marketing**: every delighted customer becomes a mini-marketer for the brand. This creates a compounding flywheel – as their client base grows, so does the pool of potential referrers. Even if each client only ever refers one more, that doubles the business. In Oceans’ case, some clients (especially those influential in communities) likely referred many more. 

The only challenge will be to maintain this referral rate as Oceans expands beyond the tight-knit startup community into more traditional mid-market companies, where referral networks are weaker. Oceans is already trying to penetrate new customer segments ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L403%20As%20Oceans,traditional%20companies%2C%20such%20as%20manufacturers)). In those, they may eventually supplement referrals with more marketing – but if they can turn new mid-market clients into advocates in their circles, the model holds. So far, Oceans has shown that *delighting customers is the most effective marketing strategy*, and their referral-driven growth is proof.

## Unique and Innovative Growth Tactics 💡

Oceans’ growth playbook has several unconventional and clever tactics that set them apart from typical outsourcing agencies. Here are the most notable ones and their impact:

- **Geographic Wedge (Sri Lanka Focus):** Perhaps Oceans’ most unique move was centering their service on Sri Lankan talent – an *untapped geography* in the offshoring world. Ian knew from prior experience that Sri Lanka had an abundance of high-caliber professionals, but unlike India or the Philippines, it wasn’t saturated with outsourcing firms ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=And%20so%20in%20December%202021%2C,working%20there%20in%20the%20past)). Oceans used this as a curiosity-sparking differentiator: *“The fact that no one uses Sri Lanka for offshore talent makes it interesting enough that people want to learn more.”* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=customers%20,with%20Oceans)) It was a brilliant way to stand out in a competitive market. Cold outreach emails that mention “top talent in Sri Lanka” likely piqued interest because it was novel. This wedge got prospects in the door, and then Oceans delivered on it by proving that Sri Lankan EAs were indeed world-class. Essentially, they created a **blue ocean strategy** in offshoring by literally going to a different ocean (Sri Lanka). This tactic worked so well that it fueled word-of-mouth – people would mention Oceans *because* of the unique Sri Lanka angle, amplifying their brand. Now Oceans is repeating the strategy in **South Africa** as well (another under-utilized talent hub with great English skills), expanding their unique geography story. By mid-2023, Ian noted they operate in South Africa too with “great talent there” ([karagoldin.com](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/ian-myers/#:~:text=Ian%20Myers%3A%20Founder%20%26%20CEO,I%20think)). Emphasizing these locations not only differentiates Oceans, it also gives them a supply advantage (access to top 1% talent where others aren’t looking) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=So%20Oceans%20is%20able%20to,easier%20than%20in%20other%20markets)).

- **“EA+” Productization:** Oceans didn’t just offer generic virtual assistants; they coined the term **EA+** and defined a premium service level. EA+ implies an Executive Assistant with something “extra” – more proactivity, business acumen, and training beyond a standard assistant. By branding their service as EA+, Oceans set client expectations that these aren’t run-of-the-mill VAs. They even developed an **EA+ Training Program** to upskill their hires before placement ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=Our%20EA%2B%20Training%20Program)). This training is taught by world-class EAs and covers best practices for supporting high-growth executives ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=Our%20EA%2B%20Training%20Program)). The innovative angle here is treating a service like a product – with standardized training, naming (“Divers”), and quality control. It gave Oceans a marketing claim (“We provide EA+ divers, not just VAs”) that suggests higher value. This tactic improved retention and referral too: clients experienced that an *Oceans EA+ = someone who can operate almost like a chief of staff*. That level of impact makes clients rave about the service. It’s an innovation because few outsourcing firms invest so much in training their talent before they ever start with a client.

- **Stacked Differentiators:** Ian realized that any single advantage (price, talent quality, location, or role specialization) might not be enough alone ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=A%20lot%20of%20offshoring%20companies,markup%2C%20and%20sell%20their%20service)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Price%20and%20exceptional%20talent%20weren%E2%80%99t,was%20the%20type%20of%20role)). Oceans’ unique tactic was to **stack multiple differentiators** to create an “entry wedge” that looked almost “too good to be true” but was real ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Price%20and%20exceptional%20talent%20weren%E2%80%99t,was%20the%20type%20of%20role)). They combined: (a) *Unbeatable price-to-quality ratio* (Sri Lanka wages for top 1% talent) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Meaning%20you%20get%20uncontested%20access,time%20employees%20for%20you)), (b) *Untapped location* (novelty factor of Sri Lanka) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=customers%20,with%20Oceans)), and (c) *Specific role focus* (Executive Assistants for startup founders). Together, this made Oceans *one-of-one* in the market ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Price%20and%20exceptional%20talent%20weren%E2%80%99t,was%20the%20type%20of%20role)). For a U.S. founder, the pitch “former Big Four consultants in Sri Lanka as your EA for ~$2–3k/month” is compelling and rare. By delivering on this promise (thanks to rigorous 6-step hiring and assessments ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=You%20Get%20the%20Best%20of,the%20Best))), they carved out a *defensible niche*. This approach was innovative because most outsourcing firms either compete on price *or* quality *or* niche – Oceans did all three simultaneously.

- **Micro-Influencer Cap Table:** As discussed in Partnerships, giving equity to influencers was a unique growth hack. Instead of spending big on marketing, Oceans “spent” a small piece of equity to onboard evangelists with massive reach ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=So%20to%20solve%20this%2C%20Oceans,could%20provide%20validation%20and%2For%20distribution)). This is not common for service businesses, yet it paid off by rapidly scaling their word-of-mouth beyond Ian’s immediate network. Essentially, Oceans growth-hacked virality by aligning incentives of people who have large followings – a one-time cost for continuous promotion.

- **Referral Flywheels:** Oceans identified and engineered *three compounding flywheels* – customer, talent, and positioning ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L369%20Oceans%20on,ARR%20in%20just%20three%20years)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=%F0%9F%99%8B%E2%80%8D%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F%20The%20Customer%20flywheel)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L476%20%F0%9F%8E%AF%20The,Positioning%20flywheel)). We’ve covered the customer (referral) flywheel and positioning (differentiation) flywheel. Another innovative tactic is the **talent flywheel**: because Oceans became known as the place for top Sri Lankan talent to work (full-time jobs, Western exposure, career growth), they attracted the best candidates ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=At%20over%20400%20people%20placed%2C,and%20an%20established%20team%20culture)). At over 400 people placed, Oceans itself is seen as a stable, prestigious employer in Sri Lanka ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L207%20At%20over,and%20an%20established%20team%20culture)). This means *more* top talent applies (1500+ applicants monthly per their site ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=1500))), letting them be even more selective and maintain quality as they scale. It’s a self-reinforcing loop that many competitors lack. This focus on *employer branding* in-country (highlighting benefits, culture, growth paths for their team) is a growth tactic often overlooked by outsourcing firms – but Oceans treated talent acquisition as seriously as client acquisition, giving them a sustainable advantage in service quality.

- **Founder’s Personal Brand & Transparency:** Ian’s approach of being open about his journey (e.g., sharing that he wanted a business that cash-flowed in 3 months and viable in 6 ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=more%20criteria%3A)), or that he runs Oceans on Google Sheets and Notion ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=))) created a relatable story that drew customers in. His LinkedIn posts dissecting concepts like the talent J-curve or mistakes they made show humility and expertise. This authenticity is somewhat unique in an industry that often just cold-sells services. It turned the founder into a magnet; people follow Ian for advice and in turn learn about Oceans.

- **Quality over Growth (early on):** A subtle tactic Oceans employed was *saying “no” to the wrong customers* after a point. Early on they said yes to everyone to get revenue, but soon they realized focusing on ideal customers (startup founders, then later selectively mid-market) was key ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Like%20many%20startups%2C%20Oceans%20made,mistake%3A%20saying%20yes%20to%20everyone)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L403%20As%20Oceans,traditional%20companies%2C%20such%20as%20manufacturers)). Turning down clients that weren’t a fit was a counterintuitive growth move that paid off – it preserved bandwidth for the right clients who would stay longer and refer others (whereas forcing fit with wrong clients might have led to churn or bad word-of-mouth). This discipline is somewhat unique for a young, bootstrapped company under pressure to grow, and it’s part of why their growth has been healthy and not hobbled by negative experiences.

**Effectiveness of Tactics:** All these innovative tactics have been **highly effective**, contributing to Oceans’ rapid and self-sustaining growth. The Sri Lanka positioning gave them initial traction and still remains a core talking point (even in 2024 press, the “remarkable Sri Lankan workforce” is emphasized ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=While%20still%20in%20its%20early,transform%20the%20global%20workforce%20landscape))). The EA+ concept and training program ensured quality service delivery, which in turn drove the referral engine. The influencer investor hack extended their reach 10x faster than organic means could. And the flywheels they set in motion mean that as they grow, things get easier (not harder) – more referrals, more top talent, stronger brand recall. 

Importantly, these tactics were cost-effective. Oceans essentially *engineered growth without pouring money into ads*, using insight and strategy instead. The differentiators they chose had staying power – competitors can’t easily copy the exact formula (few are in Sri Lanka at scale yet, and Oceans’ head start there gives them network effects with talent). In essence, Oceans found *creative “growth hacks” perfectly suited to a bootstrapper: low external cost, high compound returns*. It’s a case study in smart growth: identify an undervalued asset (Sri Lankan talent), over-deliver in quality, and let network effects do the rest.

## Geographic Talent Sourcing as a Differentiator 🌏

Leveraging talent from Sri Lanka and South Africa isn’t just an operational choice for Oceans – it’s a core part of their marketing and positioning strategy. They’ve turned their geographic focus into a **key differentiator** that they emphasize across channels:

- **Sri Lanka “Secret Sauce”:** Oceans launched around the thesis that Sri Lanka’s talent pool is world-class yet overlooked ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=And%20so%20in%20December%202021%2C,working%20there%20in%20the%20past)). Marketing-wise, this is framed as *“U.S.-caliber, offshore dream hires from Sri Lanka.”* In sales conversations and on their site, Oceans highlights how Sri Lanka produces highly educated, English-speaking professionals with experience in top global companies (there’s a strong Sri Lankan diaspora and many multinationals in Colombo). They also stress that because Sri Lanka isn’t flooded with outsourcing firms, **the supply-demand balance is favorable** – you can get the top 1% of talent at a fraction of the cost since local opportunities are fewer. As Ian explained, *“Sri Lanka’s top talent is uncontested – Oceans can identify the top percentile easier than in other markets, and you get access to that talent with Oceans taking on the employment overhead.”* ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=So%20Oceans%20is%20able%20to,easier%20than%20in%20other%20markets)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L216%20Meaning%20you,time%20employees%20for%20you)). This message tells potential clients: *you’re tapping into a goldmine your competitors don’t even know about*. Curiosity is piqued (“Why Sri Lanka?”) and Oceans then educates them on the advantages.

- **South Africa Addition:** As Oceans grew, they quietly added South Africa to their talent roster (confirmed by Ian in a 2023 podcast) ([karagoldin.com](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/ian-myers/#:~:text=Ian%20Myers%3A%20Founder%20%26%20CEO,I%20think)). South Africa offers similar benefits – a large English-speaking talent pool, cultural alignment with Western countries, and time zones that align well with Europe (and partially U.S.). Oceans likely markets South Africa as a complement to Sri Lanka: for roles or clients that might benefit from closer time overlap or Afrikaans/European language skills (SA has a diverse workforce), they have that option. They haven’t front-loaded SA in PR as much as Sri Lanka, possibly because it’s a secondary hub, but it strengthens their claim of providing *“global talent”*. In one sense, South Africa is itself a differentiator in the VA world (few competitors focus there, aside from some UK-centric firms). Oceans can now say their talent comes from two high-quality, underutilized markets – giving clients flexibility and resilience (e.g., time zone coverage nearly around the clock between the two regions).

- **Marketing the Ethos, not just the Cost:** Oceans is careful to position the geographic strategy as a win-win, not exploitation. Their messaging often highlights **empowering local professionals** and *“opening global opportunities for local talent.”* ([www.echelon.lk](https://www.echelon.lk/oceans-opening-global-opportunities-for-local-professionals/#:~:text=Kanishka%20Perera%2C%20Vice%20President%20of,class%20career%20prospects)). This casts Oceans as a positive actor, not just a cost arbitrageur. For example, in EconomyNext, Ian mentions how fully embedding Sri Lankan talent in global teams is *“reshaping the global workforce landscape”* and that tapping this talent has fueled Oceans’ rapid growth ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=the%20U,on%20their%20teams%2C%20is%20reshaping)) ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=incredible%20Sri%20Lankan%20talent%20Oceans,helped%20us%20grow%20so%20quickly)). The subtext: by hiring through Oceans, you’re not only getting a great EA, you’re also supporting a new model of global work. This resonates with founders who take pride in being forward-thinking or socially conscious. It also differentiates Oceans from outsourcing shops that might be seen as “VA mills.” Ian on Kara Goldin’s show underlined ethical practices – likely mentioning providing benefits, good salaries, and stable jobs to offshore staff ([karagoldin.com](https://karagoldin.com/podcasts/ian-myers/#:~:text=In%20this%20episode%20of%20The,AI%2C%20and%20offers%20insights%20on)) – which makes clients feel better about choosing Oceans over a low-budget freelancer marketplace.

- **Handling Objections via Differentiator:** Inevitably, hiring overseas raises questions: Will there be culture fit? Time zone issues? Communication barriers? Oceans turns these into selling points. They cite that Sri Lanka has a high literacy rate, Western-influenced education, and English fluency. Many of their hires have worked with U.S./EU companies or were educated abroad. They also ensure overlap hours; often their EAs align partially with U.S. hours and work asynchronously for the rest, leveraging remote best practices (a point to which Oceans’ content likely speaks). By addressing these in marketing materials (possibly in FAQ sections or blogs like “How to successfully work async with an EA”), they use their expertise in these regions as a reassuring differentiator – “we know how to make global teams work, you’re in good hands.”

- **Results as Proof:** Oceans can point to client outcomes to reinforce the geographic angle. E.g., “Morning Brew’s EA is in Colombo and is indispensable to their CEO.” Or “Our clients often share that their offshore EA is as effective as a domestic hire at 3-4x the cost.” These success stories turn the abstract concept of Sri Lankan/South African talent into concrete business value. Moreover, by now Oceans has built a **brand in Sri Lanka** – local press has them as poster child for the IT/BPO sector. So when pitching to U.S. clients, Oceans can say “we attract the cream of the crop there because we’re known as a top employer; you won’t get this quality if you hire on your own.” It’s a compelling differentiator backed by evidence (1500+ applicants per month demonstrate how sought-after Oceans is by talent ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/how-we-hire#:~:text=1500))).

**Effectiveness:** Positioning around Sri Lanka and South Africa has been **highly effective** for Oceans. It provided the initial spark (many of their first customers were intrigued friends of Ian who heard him talk about Sri Lankan talent being the solution to their hiring woes ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=talent%20in%20the%20U,hiring%20individuals%20from%20Sri%20Lanka))) and it remains a cornerstone of their story. In an industry where many companies compete on similar promises (“save time, save money with a VA”), Oceans’ geographic emphasis makes them memorable and credible. It’s not just marketing fluff either – the proof of concept is in their rapid growth and satisfied clients attributing value to the *“incredible Sri Lankan talent”* Oceans supplied ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=incredible%20Sri%20Lankan%20talent%20Oceans,helped%20us%20grow%20so%20quickly)). That talent edge is what helped them *“grow so quickly,”* Ian noted ([economynext.com](https://economynext.com/brand_voice/empowering-sri-lankan-talent-globally-oceans-vision-for-the-future-of-work/#:~:text=incredible%20Sri%20Lankan%20talent%20Oceans,helped%20us%20grow%20so%20quickly)).

By carefully managing this differentiator (ensuring it stays positive – focused on talent quality and opportunity, not just low cost), Oceans avoided the stigma that sometimes comes with “offshore outsourcing.” Instead, they’ve made it aspirational: clients feel they’re ahead of the curve by using Oceans, and talented individuals feel lucky to join Oceans. This virtuous cycle (which we earlier termed the talent flywheel) originates from the geographic strategy.

In summary, Oceans turned *location into a marketing weapon*. It attracted customers (for novelty and value), attracted talent (for global exposure), and built a brand around connecting the two. As they expand, maintaining this edge will be key – they may explore other underutilized talent markets (perhaps Eastern Europe or Latin America) in the future, but for now Sri Lanka/South Africa provide plenty of runway. So far, it’s a differentiator competitors have not been able to match effectively, making it a sustained competitive advantage in Oceans’ GTM.

## Founder-Led Growth and Ian Myers’ Personal Brand 🤵🚀

Ian Myers has been the driving force behind Oceans’ growth, not only as an executor of strategy but as a **marketing asset through his personal brand**. His involvement is deeply woven into nearly every channel discussed, but focusing on it specifically:

- **Network and Credibility:** Ian came into Oceans with experience (he had exited a prior startup) and a strong network of founders and venture folks. He leveraged that from day one to get Oceans off the ground. The first clients were mostly people who *knew Ian or were one degree away* – trust in him translated to trust in Oceans. This was crucial for an unproven service: friends were willing to try an EA from Sri Lanka because Ian backed it. As he proved the model, he then used those successes to win over **friends-of-friends**, expanding outward. Essentially, Ian’s personal relationships were the foundation of the referral web that followed ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L277%20Like%20most,With%20a%20key%20difference)) ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20surprising,mouth%20marketing)). Even when Oceans took on the $200k strategic investment, it was Ian’s personal credibility that convinced those angels to come on board and advocate – they believed in Ian as much as the idea.

- **Thought Leadership Content:** Ian actively shares insights, which builds his personal brand as an expert in outsourcing, remote work, and entrepreneurship. On LinkedIn, he writes long-form posts about lessons learned (e.g. the talent J-curve post) or contrarian views on delegation. In doing so, he’s essentially marketing by teaching. Readers who find value in his thoughts naturally become curious about Oceans. It’s a kind of **founder-led content marketing** that supplements official company content. For example, when he wrote “Our least successful clients have 1 thing in common… They don’t understand the talent J-Curve” ([tz.linkedin.com](https://tz.linkedin.com/posts/ian-myers-2a997852_founders-startup-talent-activity-7006264461086892033-Isod#:~:text=Our%20least%20successful%20clients%20have,Curve%20is%20just%20like%20any)), he’s indirectly saying “we at Oceans understand how to make remote talent successful, come talk to us.” This content often goes viral in the startup LinkedIn space, significantly raising Oceans’ profile. Ian also wrote at least one article on the company blog (the EA vs VA comparison ([www.oceanstalent.com](https://www.oceanstalent.com/category/hiring#:~:text=WorkflowPublishedOctober%2027%2C%2020257%20minExecutive%20Assistant,How%20are%20they%20different%3FIan%20Myers))), which adds founder authority to the content mix.

- **Media and Podcasts:** Ian’s personal brand as a savvy bootstrap founder got him invitations to podcasts (Kara Goldin, Startup Hustle) and features in newsletters (Young Money coffee chat, etc.) ([www.youngmoney.co](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/coffee-chat-1-ian-myers#:~:text=Coffee%20Chat%20,you%20can%20join%20the%20tens)). He has a compelling narrative – quitting a VC path, accidentally building a $10M business, focusing on lifestyle and profitability – which media love. By telling his story, he’s essentially doing PR for Oceans in a very authentic way. Importantly, he often shares not just the success but also the *how*, giving practical tips. This generosity with knowledge endears him to audiences. Each media appearance increases his following and credibility, which then loops back to Oceans (people go, “I like how this guy thinks, what does his company do exactly?”).

- **Active Engagement and Networking:** Ian doesn’t just broadcast; he engages. He presumably spends time interacting in founder forums, answering questions about hiring EAs, perhaps even cold-emailing or DMing people he sees discussing relevant pain points (“Saw you tweeted you’re overwhelmed – have you considered a remote EA? Happy to share what we do at Oceans.”). As a founder-led company, this ground-level engagement can yield high conversions. Founders appreciate speaking directly with another founder, not just a salesperson. Ian did this at least in the beginning – he personally handled inquiries and sales calls, lending gravitas and personalization. As the company grows, he might step back from day-to-day sales, but likely still jumps in for big clients or if a well-known tech figure is considering Oceans. 

- **Personal Brand as Trust Signal:** On Oceans’ website and materials, Ian’s presence is noticeable. He’s the one giving interviews, his story often opens up blog posts or PR (e.g. Sheldon’s letter starts with sitting down with Ian to get the story ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Well%20this%20week%20is%20extra,ARR%20in%20just%203%20years))). Oceans isn’t faceless – it’s *“Ian Myers’ company.”* This is intentional; it humanizes the brand and conveys leadership. Many outsourcing companies are faceless entities which can make potential clients wary (“who’s running this? do they understand my needs?”). With Oceans, clients see Ian – a guy who appears on podcasts and openly shares business metrics – and that transparency builds trust. It suggests competence and honesty at the helm, which reduces perceived risk for clients signing a contract.

- **Founder’s Vision in Marketing:** Ian’s vision extends to the brand ethos. The emphasis on values (no exploitation, creating great jobs, etc.) is an extension of his personal philosophy (after doing a VC startup, he wanted a business aligned with his life values ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=After%20realizing%20finance%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20for,backed%20startups%20come%20with%20a)) ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=The%20Life%20Ian%20Built%3A%20The,Real%20Goal))). This consistency makes the marketing feel sincere. When he speaks about treating his team well or building a business for the long haul, it’s credible because he’s living it. Customers attracted by that vision are likely a good fit (they value the same things), creating harmony between marketing promise and delivery.

**Effectiveness:** Founder-led growth has been **extremely effective** for Oceans. In the early phase, it was indispensable – without Ian pounding the pavement (physically or virtually) and championing the concept, Oceans might never have gotten that first critical mass of clients. His personal brand continues to amplify Oceans far beyond what a small marketing budget could do. For example, a single viral LinkedIn post of his might reach tens of thousands of people (for free), equivalent to a big ad spend. The trust factor of “advice from a successful founder” far exceeds that of ads too, leading to high conversion of those reached. Also, Ian’s network has opened doors: Oceans counts movers and shakers as clients or supporters because Ian could connect and make the pitch in a credible way.

However, reliance on the founder can be a double-edged sword if not balanced – it doesn’t scale infinitely. Oceans seems to be transitioning well: using Ian’s brand as a boost while building institutional marketing (the blog, a sales team, etc.). But Ian remains a very active public face, which is likely a net positive as long as he can scale his time on critical tasks.

In conclusion, Ian Myers’ personal brand and founder-led efforts have **greatly accelerated Oceans’ growth** at low cost. It’s been a cornerstone strategy: by making Ian synonymous with expertise in global talent and efficient entrepreneurship, Oceans gains a competitive edge in trust and visibility. As one comment put it, his journey proves you don’t need big funding or a revolutionary idea – *“deliver exceptional service, let happy customers drive your growth”* ([www.moneymakingstory.com](https://www.moneymakingstory.com/p/built-a-10m-business-accidentally-from-finance-to-freedom#:~:text=Many%20people%20fear%20making%20the,But%20Ian%E2%80%99s%20advice%20is%20simple)) – which is exactly what he’s done, and he’s made sure the world hears about it.

---

**Conclusion:** Oceans’ GTM and marketing strategy is a mosaic of savvy tactics unified by one theme – **leverage quality (in talent and service) to drive organic growth**. They prioritized customer success and unique positioning over splashy ad spends, and it paid off in viral referrals and strong brand differentiation. By excelling in content and SEO recently, they’re setting up for sustained inbound interest, while partnerships and PR have expanded their reach without heavy spend. Oceans demonstrates how a service business can scale rapidly by turning every facet of operations (from how you hire talent to how the founder tweets) into a marketing advantage. Each channel – whether blog, LinkedIn post, or podcast – reinforces the others, creating a robust presence far larger than a typical startup of their size. The effectiveness is evident in the numbers: from zero to $15M ARR in 3 years ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=Within%207%20months%2C%20Oceans%20was,Oceans%E2%80%99%20biggest%20growth%20channel%20today)) ([www.sheldonsletter.com](https://www.sheldonsletter.com/p/how-oceans-grew-to-15million#:~:text=match%20at%20L369%20Oceans%20on,ARR%20in%20just%20three%20years)), and a reputation in both Silicon Valley circles and the Sri Lankan talent community that continues to fuel its growth. Oceans will likely continue this playbook, perhaps doubling down on content and maybe selectively increasing paid campaigns as they tackle new markets. But the core engine – exceptional offshore talent + happy customers = growth – will remain their north star, as it’s proven to be both unique and incredibly effective.
