# **Calendar-Based AI Delegation Suggestions**

Based on an analysis of past calendar events, the following recommendations are made to delegate tasks to the new Executive Assistant (EA) that will provide leverage for Chris.

## **Strategic Relationship Management:**

* **Contacts Curation:** EA could maintain an up-to-date contact list with personal details, last interaction synopsis, and potential touchpoints for Chris. For example, information from Chris's meeting on Market St with Joanie should be documented and accessible for follow-ups.  
* **Post-Event Follow-Ups:** Following events like the "HF0 Angels Demo Day" or "Agents Showcase", the EA could manage communication with valuable contacts or leads, ensuring opportunities don’t slip through the cracks.  
* **Meeting Briefs:** Develop comprehensive briefs for meetings such as "GTM Follow-up" and "Conviction Embed Demo Day," providing context, objectives, likely discussion points, and past engagements with participants.

  ## **Project Roadmap Collaboration:**

* **Roadmap Enhancement:** The EA can take an active role in refining and documenting the roadmaps discussed in cognitive team meetings, working alongside pod leads to ensure clarity and alignment with broader objectives.  
* **Team Interface:** Act as liaison between Chris and Activation pod leads, relaying guidance, and consolidating feedback for meetings like “Cognitive coaching session with leads from the Activation pod.”

  ## **Health and Personal Wellbeing Scheduling:**

* **Wellness Appointments:** Systematically arrange and prepare for sessions like "Othership \- Social Guide" events, ensuring Chris's mental and physical well-being is prioritized within his schedule.  
* **Learning and Development:**  
  * **Behavior Course Oversight:** Monitor Chris’s progress with courses like the "Weekly check-in for behavior course," suggesting additional resources or scheduling extra sessions where necessary.  
  * **Event and Conference Prep:** For events such as "The 2nd Annual Cardiovascular Health Tech Conference," the EA could compile research briefs or key questions to ensure Chris gains the maximum value from attendance.  
* **Innovation and Tech Exploration:**  
  * **Collaborative Tech Scouting:** After events like "Supercharge Sales & Marketing with AI," the EA could help with exploring potential applications and partnerships for the discussed AI tools within Chris’s projects.  
* **Prioritization and Time Management:**  
  * **Agenda Setting:** Strategically develop agendas, like for "1-1 meetings with CY and EM," focusing on high-impact discussions, thus maximizing Chris’s time and efforts.  
  * **Monthly Reviews:** Take charge of time blocks marked as done in Reclaim, suggesting adjustments based on the project phase, such as after the completion of a milestone.  
* **Sales and Marketing Strategy:**  
  * **Value Proposition Refinement:** Following meetings like "GTM Follow-up...MaaS Service Upsell," the EA could work on refining sales collateral and outreach strategies.  
* **Personal Tasks Optimization:**  
  * **Errands Coordination:** Oversee personal appointments, such as haircuts or doctor’s visits, balancing them with professional commitments, ensuring Chris can focus on high-leverage activities.  
* **Confidential Meeting Handling:**  
  * **Secure Communications:** Develop and maintain a protocol for arranging and managing sensitive meetings, like those dubbed "secret meetings," to ensure absolute discretion and privacy.

  These recommendations leverage the EA’s position to not only handle logistical tasks but also engage strategically across all areas of Chris's professional and personal life. By integrating these suggestions into the EA’s remit, they will be empowered to drive significant value and efficiency for Chris.
