## 👩‍⚕️ **My Delegation Experience (TO BE DELETED PRE-UM APPROVAL and BEFORE SENDING TO CLIENT)**

💡 This section aims to understand clients’ past experiences with delegation and assistants so that we can deliver content and an experience that is personalized to them. This section also allows the PM to gauge clients’ acceptance of 1:1 partnerships and the effort required to build a successful partnership.

* Have you had any prior experience with Assistants before and how did it go?  
  * If so, was your assistant dedicated to you?  
* Is there anything that would prevent you from working with a foreign/ remote worker?

## **👥 The Basics**

💡 What are the most important details to know about the client’s life? Do we need to be aware of time zone changes, multiple houses to manage, heavy travel planning, etc.?

This section should prime the idea that the client will need to introduce their EA to the key stakeholders in their life. The goal is long-term, deep integration of the EA into the client’s life for maximum success.

## **🙂 My Outlook & Inspiration**

💡 This section builds off the last one and encourages the client to think aspirationally and introspectively about life. We want to understand where the client’s EA should really lean in (by helping to maximize what energizes the client) and where they should absolutely steer clear (by helping to minimize what drains or annoys the client).

This section should prime opportunities for refinement or improvement in the client’s life. It also presents an opportunity to discuss how the EA’s goal is to protect the client’s work time and rest time.

## **🤝 Working With Me**

💡 These questions should clearly define what it is like to work with the client. This section should set the EA up to do the right things immediately. It can also open space for the client to talk about what excellent would look like.

These questions should clearly define where the client’s trust battery is from the start. Careful framing can help to pull this out: it’s an opportunity to ask for anecdotes about when people have gained or lost trust with the client. It can also open space for the client to talk about how they like to give or receive feedback.

* **Script to present the 7 work compatibility questions** (aka matching, if not completed)

   *OK, here’s one of the my favorite parts of this call. I’m going to ask you seven questions to get an idea of who you’re most compatible working with. Our matching team uses these questions to choose candidates who closely align with your desired working style. Don’t overthink these questions \- just go with your gut. There are no right or wrong answers. They will require a bit of tough decision-making, but I’ll ask you to choose just one answer even if both options are appealing.*

  1. Question \#1: *Do you prefer to work with people who make decisions quickly with a margin for error or people who to take more time with decisions but have a higher degree of confidence?*  
     1. Speed of execution vs. accuracy of decisions  
  2. Question \#2: *Do you prefer to work with people who are motivated by achieving small milestones or pursuing big-picture outcomes?*  
     1. Achieving small tangible goals vs. working towards visionary ideas  
  3. Question \#3: *Do you prefer to work with people who collaborate best synchronously or asynchronously when making a big decision?*  
     1. Live collaboration vs. independent processing  
  4. Question \#4: *When working towards a goal, do you prefer to work with people whose strength is having defined processes or just the end goal in mind?*  
     1. Working with detailed instructions or working with an end goal in mind  
  5. Question \#5: *Do you prefer to work with people who thrive on autonomy, or people who work best with schedules and structure?*  
     1. Flexibility vs. structure in your work environment  
  6. Question \#6: *In decision making, do you prefer to work with people who rely heavily on outside information and data, or people who are more driven by instinct?*  
     1. Relying on data vs. intuition in decision making  
  7. Question \#7: *Do you prefer to work with people who bring emotion and passion to work, or people who maintain a psychological distance between work and life?*  
     1. Emotional investment vs. emotional separation in your work  
* **Script to rank work compatibility answers**

   The last step of this process is to identify the 3 areas of compatibility that are most important to you. First, is there one that is absolutely stood out? And if you were to choose another two that are most important in finding the right person for you, which would those be?

## **💬 Communicating With Me**

💡 The main priority, though, is to get a good sense of which tools client will use with their EA. Be sure to remind the client to add their EA to their communication ecosystem as soon as possible (pre-Kickoff Call ideally).

**If the client has indicated they will not have their EA use an Athena-issued device, discuss next steps for client sending their own device.**
