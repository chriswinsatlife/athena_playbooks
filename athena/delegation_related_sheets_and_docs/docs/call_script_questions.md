1. \<Client\>, your side of the commitment means you agree to invest the necessary time and energy in your work together, and to grant access to your life so your XP can be successful. It also means you’re ready for challenges, and you won’t get everything right on the first shot, but you’re prepared to provide lots of feedback to ensure your growth together. Does that sound doable?  
2. **\[For a small subset of clients, only if “a VIP, neurodivergent, or a major churn risk.“\]** Are you interested in delegation coaching?
