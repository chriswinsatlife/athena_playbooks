### 3

**<Your Company> / <Their Company>:** 🎯 [Company] Goals

---

### 4

**<Your Company> / <Their Company>:** Currently there is inconsistent use of MAPs executed in sheets for POCs, and it puts larger deals at risk. Reps are low maturity when it comes to MAPs and need both process & enablement.   With deals that take several months, have multiple stakeholders, and involve POCs, there's an opportunity to increase both conversion & deal velocity by:  - Getting reps executing 10/10 mutual plans on every deal - Securing the outcome and timeline on bigger deals - Upfront contracting evaluations and POCs to better qualify & convert - Effectively guiding customers from interest to live
