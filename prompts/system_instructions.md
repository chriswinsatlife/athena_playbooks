# System Instructions

These instructions are appended to every diagram generation prompt.

## Critical Requirements

1. **NO LOGOS** - Do not include any company logos, brand marks, or wordmarks in the output. Logo placement is handled separately via post-processing.

2. **NO WATERMARKS** - Do not add any watermarks, signatures, or attribution text to the image.

3. **CLEAN EDGES** - Leave clean margins around the content. Do not extend design elements to the absolute edge of the canvas.

4. **TEXT ACCURACY** - All text must be spelled correctly and rendered clearly. No garbled, corrupted, or placeholder text.

5. **FLAT BACKGROUND** - Use a solid, flat background color. No gradients, patterns, or textures on the background unless explicitly specified in the template.

6. **CONSISTENT STYLE** - All visual elements (icons, shapes, typography) must be stylistically consistent throughout the diagram.
