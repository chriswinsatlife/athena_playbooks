# Infinity Lifecycle Template

A dual-loop process diagram used to illustrate continuous, interconnected lifecycles or feedback loops with a central transition point.

## Layout Structure

- **Hierarchical Centering:** The diagram is centered horizontally and vertically within the lower 70% of the canvas.
- **Dual-Loop Geometry:** Two identical circular paths joined by a diagonal "bridge" element, forming a horizontal figure-eight (infinity) symbol.
- **Internal Hubs:** Each loop contains a central circular "hub" that serves as the focal point for that specific cycle.
- **Segmented Paths:** Each side of the loop is divided into three distinct radial segments (total of 6 segments across the loop).
- **Directional Flow:** Implied clockwise or counter-clockwise movement through numbered segments, converging at the central bridge.

## Proportions and Spacing

- **Header Zone:** Occupies approximately the top 25-30% of the total height.
- **Loop Diameter:** Each circle in the infinity loop is roughly 40% of the total canvas width.
- **Hub Size:** Central hubs are approximately 35-40% of the diameter of their containing loops.
- **Bridge Width:** The diagonal connecting bridge is roughly 20% of the diameter of one loop.
- **External Padding:** Generous margins (at least 10% of width/height) around the entire diagram to ensure breathing room for labels.

## Visual Hierarchy

- **Primary Elements:** The central "DEPLOY" bridge and the two inner hubs represent the core concepts.
- **Secondary Elements:** The six colored segments forming the outer path of the loops.
- **Tertiary Elements:** Circled numbers and external text labels providing specific step details.
- **Hierarchy Drivers:** Established through central positioning, color saturation in the bridge, and large-scale typography in the title.

## Typography Hierarchy

- **Main Title ($CONTENT_TITLE):** Large, bold sans-serif, roughly 3.5x-4x the size of body text.
- **Subtitle ($CONTENT_SUBTITLE):** Medium weight sans-serif, roughly 1.5x the size of body text, placed directly under the title.
- **Bridge Label ($CONTENT_BRIDGE):** All-caps, heavy weight, rotated 45 degrees to match the bridge angle.
- **Hub Text:** Distinctive style (e.g., italic or script) to contrast with technical labels, centered in hubs.
- **Step Labels:** Small, bold sans-serif text placed outside the diagram, aligned with the relevant segment.

## Color Usage Pattern

- **background-color:** A solid, light, neutral wash for the entire canvas.
- **primary-color:** Applied to one side of the loop (segments 4, 5, 6) to distinguish the "Calibration" or "Left" phase.
- **secondary-color:** Applied to the other side of the loop (segments 1, 2, 3) to distinguish the "Development" or "Right" phase.
- **accent-color:** Used for the central "bridge" to highlight the critical transition/deployment phase.
- **surface-color:** Used for the inner hubs and number circles to provide high contrast against the colored segments.
- **border-color:** Thin, dark, consistent outlines on all geometric shapes to define boundaries.
- **text-primary:** Dark color for all titles and labels for maximum legibility.

## Shapes and Elements

- **Geometric Foundation:** Perfect circles and arcs.
- **Bridge Shape:** A parallelogram with pointed ends that integrates into the circular arcs.
- **Segment Styling:** "Chunky" arcs with defined borders, giving a modular appearance.
- **Number Indicators:** Small white circles with black borders containing single digits.
- **Line Style:** Clean, uniform weight lines (no tapering).

## Key Design Patterns

- **Bilateral Symmetry:** The left and right loops mirror each other in scale and complexity.
- **Radial Alignment:** External labels are placed in the "white space" created by the circular geometry, radiating outward from the center of each loop.
- **Visual Rhythm:** The repetition of three segments per side creates a predictable, rhythmic flow.
- **Information Density:** Sparse to medium; the diagram relies on significant negative space to maintain clarity.

## Content Zones

- `$CONTENT_TITLE` - Large central heading at the top.
- `$CONTENT_SUBTITLE` - Explanatory sub-header.
- `$CONTENT_HUB_LEFT` - Core label for the left cycle.
- `$CONTENT_HUB_RIGHT` - Core label for the right cycle.
- `$CONTENT_BRIDGE` - Label for the central transition point.
- `$CONTENT_SEGMENTS_LEFT` - Content for segments 4, 5, and 6.
- `$CONTENT_SEGMENTS_RIGHT` - Content for segments 1, 2, and 3.
- `$CONTENT_LABELS` - Descriptive text blocks positioned outside the loops.

## Critical Reproduction Notes

1. **The Bridge Rotation:** The text within the central bridge must be perfectly parallel to the bridge's diagonal edges.
2. **Consistent Outlines:** Every shape (segments, hubs, numbers) must have the same border weight.
3. **Hub Centering:** The text in the hubs must be perfectly centered within those inner circles.
4. **Label Alignment:** External labels should be visually associated with their specific segment through proximity.

## Anti-patterns

- **Overlapping Text:** Do not let external labels touch the diagram borders.
- **Mismatched Radii:** Ensure the left and right circles are mathematically identical.
- **Inconsistent Numbering:** Numbers should follow a logical sequence (e.g., clockwise) that matches the intended process flow.
- **Gradient Overuse:** Avoid complex gradients; stick to solid fills or very subtle tints to maintain a clean, diagrammatic look.
