# Anchor & Tag Cloud Template

This diagram is used to visualize a collection of related terms, concepts, or components associated with a single central theme or "source" object.

## Layout Structure

- **Spatial Organization:** A bottom-weighted composition featuring a large "anchor" object with a cloud of floating "tags" above it.
- **Distinct Zones:** 
    - **Anchor Zone:** Occupies the lower 40-50% of the frame, centered horizontally.
    - **Tag Zone:** Occupies the upper 50-60% of the frame, containing floating elements in an organic arc.
- **Flow Direction:** Elements emerge vertically from the anchor object into the top half of the frame.
- **Relationship:** Adjacency and implied connection via "pointer" tails on the tags directed toward the anchor.

## Proportions and Spacing

- **Anchor Size:** The central object is approximately 50-60% of the total width and 40% of the height.
- **Tag Sizes:** Varying sizes based on text length; the largest tags are roughly 1/5th the width of the anchor.
- **Margins:** Comfortable "breathing room" of ~10% padding on all sides.
- **Vertical Spacing:** Tags are clustered at varying heights to create a sense of depth and organic floating.

## Visual Hierarchy

- **Primary Element:** The anchor object (largest mass, central position, contains main title).
- **Secondary Elements:** The floating tags (high contrast against the background).
- **Tertiary Elements:** Decorative icons on the anchor surface and supporting graphic lines (e.g., page lines, highlights).
- **Hierarchy Establishment:** Established through scale (large anchor vs. small tags) and layering (tags appear "in front" of the background space).

## Typography Hierarchy

- **Main Title ($CONTENT_TITLE):** Large, bold, sans-serif. Should be warped or angled to match the perspective of the anchor's surface.
- **Tag Text ($CONTENT_TAGS):** Medium weight, sans-serif, centered. Relative size is ~50-60% of the main title.
- **Casing:** Use of mix-case for readability, or all-caps for short acronyms to provide visual variety.
- **Line Density:** Sparse; single words or short phrases per tag.

## Color Usage Pattern

- **background-color:** A solid, warm or neutral light tint to provide a soft environment.
- **surface-color:** Used for the interior of the tags and internal "cutaway" parts of the anchor (e.g., book pages) to create high-contrast text areas.
- **primary-color:** The dominant brand color applied to the exterior of the anchor object.
- **secondary-color:** Used for offset "hard" shadows behind tags to create a "sticker" or 3D effect.
- **accent-color:** Used for small illustrative details or icons on the anchor surface.
- **text-primary / border-color:** A single dark, high-contrast color used for all text and all object outlines (thick stroke style).

## Shapes and Elements

- **Shape Language:** Rounded rectangles for tags; geometric but slightly stylized 3D representation for the anchor.
- **Border Treatments:** Thick, consistent weight (e.g., 2-3pt relative) on all elements to create a cohesive illustrative style.
- **Shadow/Depth:** Subtle 3D perspective on the anchor; flat, offset secondary-color "dropshadow" shapes behind tags.
- **Connectors:** Triangular "pointer" tails on the bottom of tags, varied in angle to point toward the center of the anchor.

## Key Design Patterns

- **Sticker Aesthetic:** Every element has a bold outline and a flat offset shadow, making them feel like physical objects placed on the background.
- **Visual Rhythm:** Tags are placed at staggered heights and horizontal positions to avoid a rigid grid.
- **Information Density:** Low to medium; focuses on key terms rather than deep descriptions.
- **Alignment:** Central horizontal alignment for the overall composition; perspective alignment for text on the anchor.

## Content Zones

- **$CONTENT_TITLE:** Main category or theme name placed on the anchor object.
- **$CONTENT_ANCHOR_ICON:** A decorative graphic or logo related to the theme, placed on the anchor.
- **$CONTENT_TAGS:** A collection of 5-8 short terms or phrases, each enclosed in a floating bubble.

## Critical Reproduction Notes

1. **Perspective Matching:** The main title must be transformed to match the 3D plane of the anchor object surface.
2. **Consistent Line Weight:** Use the same stroke thickness for tags, the anchor, and the tag pointers.
3. **Hard Shadows:** Use offset solid shapes (not soft blurs) for shadows to maintain the illustrative look.
4. **Pointer Direction:** Ensure all tag "tails" point generally toward the top surface of the anchor.

## Anti-patterns

- **Overcrowding:** Including more than 8-10 tags makes the "cloud" feel cluttered.
- **Grid Alignment:** Do not align tags in a perfect grid; it destroys the "floating" effect.
- **Soft Effects:** Avoid gradients or soft Gaussian shadows; stick to solid color blocks and strokes.
- **Thin Outlines:** Using thin or variable line weights will break the cohesive "sticker" aesthetic.
