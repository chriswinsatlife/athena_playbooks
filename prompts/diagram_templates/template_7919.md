# Circular Flywheel Template

This diagram is used to represent a "flywheel" effect, where a sequence of steps or events feeds back into the start to create a self-reinforcing momentum or ecosystem.

## Layout Structure

- **Element Arrangement:** Radial/Circular. A central core is surrounded by an outer ring divided into interlocking segments.
- **Number of Zones:** 3 primary zones: a header zone, a central graphic zone, and a footer zone.
- **Flow Direction:** Clockwise. The segments are shaped like stylized chevrons to indicate directional movement.
- **Relationship:** Sequential adjacency. Each segment flows into the next. Floating label cards are positioned over the segments to provide detail.

## Proportions and Spacing

- **Header Height:** ~15% of total canvas height.
- **Flywheel Diameter:** ~70% of the total canvas width/height.
- **Ring Thickness:** The outer ring thickness is approximately 30-35% of the total radius of the flywheel.
- **Central Void:** The inner white circle has a diameter of ~40% of the total flywheel width.
- **Label Cards:** Rectangular cards occupy ~20-25% of the canvas width each.
- **Margins:** Exterior padding is approximately 8-10% on all sides.

## Visual Hierarchy

- **Primary Elements:** The large, colored ring segments of the flywheel.
- **Secondary Elements:** The text labels contained within high-contrast floating cards.
- **Tertiary Elements:** The central empty hub and subtle motion lines that reinforce the sense of rotation.
- **Hierarchy Establishment:** Established through size (the flywheel), contrast (white cards on colored backgrounds), and central positioning.

## Typography Hierarchy

- **Main Title:** Bold sans-serif, centered at the top. Size is ~2.5x the body text.
- **Label Text:** Bold, all-caps or heavy-weight sans-serif. It can have a slightly informal or "hand-drawn" feel.
- **Alignment:** All text is centered within its respective container (canvas or card).
- **Line Spacing:** Tight leading within cards to keep text blocks compact and punchy.

## Color Usage Pattern

- **Background Treatment:** Solid `background-color` (typically a warm or neutral off-white).
- **Primary Color Usage:** Applied to the main flywheel segments in varying shades or alternating tints to distinguish steps.
- **Surface Color:** Used for the label cards (`surface-color`) and the central hub to provide maximum contrast against the ring.
- **Neutral Color Usage:** `text-primary` used for all text and thick `border-color` used for all outlines.
- **Contrast Pattern:** High-contrast borders (thick black lines) separate all distinct geometric elements.

## Shapes and Elements

- **Shape Language:** A mix of geometric and "sketched" styles. Heavy use of rounded rectangles for labels and a segmented "donut" for the main graphic.
- **Border Treatments:** Heavy, consistent stroke weight on all elements (cards, segments, central circle).
- **Shadow/Depth:** Flat design with no shadows, relying on thick outlines and color blocks for depth.
- **Connectors:** The segments themselves are interlocking chevrons, eliminating the need for separate arrows.
- **Accents:** Small curved "motion lines" outside the ring to suggest rotation.

## Key Design Patterns

- **Repetition and Rhythm:** The five-fold symmetry creates a sense of balance and continuous motion.
- **Visual Grouping:** Content is grouped into discrete "cards" that bridge the gap between segments.
- **Information Density:** Medium. Focuses on five core concepts without excessive explanatory text.
- **Alignment:** The labels are mathematically distributed around the center point, roughly at 0°, 72°, 144°, 216°, and 288°.

## Content Zones

- `$CONTENT_TITLE` - The main heading describing the process (e.g., "The Growth Flywheel").
- `$CONTENT_STEP_1` through `$CONTENT_STEP_5` - Short, punchy descriptions of each stage in the loop.
- `$CONTENT_CENTER_LOGO` - Optional space in the middle for a core brand icon or central theme.
- `$CONTENT_FOOTER_LEFT` - Secondary branding or source attribution.
- `$CONTENT_FOOTER_RIGHT` - Primary branding or author attribution.

## Critical Reproduction Notes

1. **Chevron Interlocking:** Ensure the segments have the "V" shape overlap to clearly communicate the direction of the flow.
2. **Stroke Weight:** Use a thick, prominent border color for all elements to maintain the "illustrated" look.
3. **Card Positioning:** Labels should float on top of the ring, ideally positioned over the "seams" between segments to tie the process together.
4. **Color Variety:** Use 3-5 tints of the `primary-color` or `secondary-color` for the segments to create visual distinction while maintaining harmony.

## Anti-patterns

- **Missing Borders:** Removing the thick outlines makes the diagram look like a standard pie chart rather than a flywheel.
- **Counter-clockwise Flow:** Reversing the chevron direction breaks the conventional "moving forward" mental model.
- **Overcrowded Labels:** Using more than 6 words per label card reduces legibility and visual impact.
- **Thin Lines:** Using hairline strokes makes the graphic feel weak and loses the high-contrast professional-yet-approachable aesthetic.
