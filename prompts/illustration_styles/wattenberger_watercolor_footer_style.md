# Ink & Watercolor Vignette

## Style Summary

This style features a delicate marriage of loose, sketchy ink work and translucent watercolor washes. It is characterized by an extreme horizontal composition where detailed subjects are grounded at the bottom of the frame, leaving a vast, airy expanse of white negative space above.

## Composition Recipe

- Frame: Extreme panoramic; the top 50-70% of the image is pure white negative space.
- Subject placement: Primary subjects and environment are clustered along the bottom edge in a continuous horizontal band.
- Depth cues: Overlapping layers of flora or objects; foreground elements are larger and more saturated, while background elements bleed into the white.
- Balance: Weighted heavily toward the bottom; horizontal "ground" line is irregular and organic.

## Medium and Mark-Making

- Medium: Fine-liner ink pens combined with traditional watercolor washes.
- Linework: Variable-weight black ink outlines; "nervous" or sketchy strokes with occasional breaks and overshoots.
- Wash behavior: High transparency with visible "blooms," pigment pooling at the edges of shapes, and soft bleeds.
- Texture: Visible cold-press watercolor paper grain; intentional pigment splatters and "salt" effects in focused areas.

## Color System

- Palette character: Fresh and naturalistic with high-chroma accents; predominantly earthy and botanical.
- Roles:
  - background: Pristine white paper, no fill.
  - large masses: Varied greens and organic earth tones.
  - focal accents: Highly saturated warm pops (yellows, oranges, or reds).
  - shadows: Cool-toned washes (cerulean or violet) rather than grey or black.
- Contrast strategy: High contrast between fine black ink lines and white paper; low contrast within the soft watercolor washes.

## Rendering Constraints

- Keep: Sketchy ink outlines, significant white space above subjects, translucent layering, visible paper texture.
- Avoid: Solid filled backgrounds, digital gradients, thick uniform borders, heavy shadows, centered vertical compositions.
