- ## Where EMS Fits for Readers Following the Andy Galpin Workout Style

The Andy Galpin workout routine is centered on building speed, strength, power, and work capacity through structured training methods backed by performance science. His own programming revolves around traditional resistance work, sprint based conditioning, and recovery systems developed through human performance research. [Electrical Muscle Stimulation](https://routines.club/ems-training/ultimate-guide-to-ems-training) is not a method he emphasizes in his personal approach. That said, for readers training alongside demanding work schedules, irregular recovery, or limited weekly gym access, EMS can still be explored as a separate tool that adds muscular input without disrupting structured performance training.

  - **High output muscle work without complex setups:** EMS triggers muscle contractions directly, allowing users to stimulate large muscle groups without building full training circuits or loading heavy equipment. This can be useful on days when structured workouts feel difficult to execute.
  - **Neural demand without sprint level fatigue:** EMS places a noticeable demand on the nervous system without the cardiovascular strain of repeated sprint work. This makes it useful for readers who want stimulation without fully taxing their conditioning systems.
  - **Visionbody EMS suit training format:** The [Visionbody EMS suit](https://visionbodyusa.myshopify.com/?ref=routines) is built for short, guided training sessions that apply electrical stimulation across major muscle groups at the same time. Visionbody states that users can achieve the muscle activation of a much longer traditional workout in just 20 minutes, with claims of engaging up to 98 percent of muscle fibers during a single session.
  - **Muscle tension without traditional loading patterns:** EMS creates force inside the muscle rather than through gravity based resistance. This allows muscles to experience tension without the same movement patterns used in squats, presses, and pulls.
  - **Training stimulus when motivation is low:** EMS introduces a very different physical sensation than conventional lifting. This novelty can help some users stay consistent during periods when regular gym sessions feel mentally draining.
  - **Added muscular work without extending training blocks:** Short EMS sessions can be placed on off days without turning into full workouts. This helps increase weekly muscle stimulation without reshaping the entire training schedule.

For readers influenced by Andy Galpin’s workout plan who want a way to layer in extra muscle engagement during unpredictable training weeks, EMS can function as a flexible add on that supports consistency without interfering with core strength and performance work.

## Speed and Power Workouts

He focuses on the importance of using speed and power training to maintain athleticism and improve overall physical performance.

  - **Frequency**: Once a week, typically following a rest day or light workout.
  - **Duration**: 5-10 minutes of high-intensity exercises, not including warm-up and cool-down.
  - **Exercises**: Medicine ball slams/throws, box jumps, clapping pushups, short sprints (10-30 meters), plyometric exercises
  - **Goal**: Finish feeling like you could do more, focusing on quality of movement rather than exhaustion.
  - **Volume**: Keep total repetitions low (3-5 per set) to maintain maximum power output.
  - **Rest**: Full recovery between sets (1-2 minutes) to ensure maximum effort on each repetition.
  - **Progression**: Increase complexity of movements or height/distance of jumps/throws as power improves.

These workouts help develop explosive power, improve neuromuscular coordination, and maintain athleticism. Dr. Galpin stresses the importance of proper technique and full recovery between efforts to maximize power output and minimize injury risk.
