This profile must include **both verified professional achievements and any available, reliably sourced personal insights** (hobbies, preferences, etc.).\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION #1: ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT - AVOID MISIDENTIFICATION.**\n* Many people share the same name. You MUST use **{{ $json.company_name }} (URL: {{ $json.company_url }})** and their known professional roles as strict filters.\n* **Verification Rule:** If you find *any* piece of information (professional OR personal) but **cannot confidently link it** to the *correct* {{ $json.person_name }} associated with {{ $json.company_name }}, **YOU MUST DISCARD IT.** Do not guess.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION #2: ACTIVELY SEEK VERIFIED PERSONAL DETAILS.**\n* While maintaining accuracy, actively search *within verified sources* for publicly shared personal details. We want to understand the person, not just the professional.\n\n**Research Areas (Verify Each Point):**\n\n1.  **Establish & Verify Professional Context:**\n    * Confirm current and past roles at {{ $json.company_name }}.\n    * Document educational background and previous key roles/companies. **(Use these as anchors).**\n    * Identify expertise and key professional achievements.\n    * Detail their role and impact specifically at {{ $json.company_name }}.\n\n2.  **Identify Confirmed Public Presence & Sources:**\n    * Locate their **verified** LinkedIn profile.\n    * Find interviews (print, audio, video), podcasts, and articles where they are **explicitly identified with {{ $json.company_name }} or their known, verified career path.** **(These are your primary sources for personal details).**\n    * Find any **confirmed** personal blogs or writings linked from verified professional sources.\n\n3.  **Extract Personal Insights (From Verified Sources ONLY):**\n    * **Once a source is confirmed as being about the *correct* person**, carefully review it for:\n        * **Directly Stated Hobbies & Activities:** Look for phrases like \"I enjoy...\", \"In my spare time...\", etc. (e.g., sports, arts, music, reading, coding, travel).\n        * **Explicit Preferences:** Note any mentioned favorites (books, authors, music, movies, food, etc.).\n        * **Shared Personal Routines/Habits:** Any specific daily routines or personal habits discussed.\n        * **Articulated Motivations/Philosophies:** Personal values, life views, or sources of motivation they've shared.\n        * **Relevant Personal Anecdotes:** Stories shared *by them* that offer context.\n    * **Prioritize direct quotes or first-person accounts** for personal information.\n    * **If a source seems personal but doesn't clearly identify the person as *our* target, DO NOT use it.**\n\n4.  **Map Network & Influence (Verified):**\n    * Identify key professional connections or board memberships.\n\n**Cite ALL information meticulously, indicating the source and your confidence (implicitly through selection, explicitly if needed).**",

Keas reduced health risks for millions of people, typically registered more than half of an eligible population where it was available, and created meaningful user engagement at an average of 14 times per month. Fortune 500 employers including Pfizer, Safeway, Land O’Lakes, J.B. Hunt, Salesforce, and Lincoln Financial relied on Keas to power their health management programs.

          "org_deep_research_data": "# Athena: Executive Assistant Company Overview\n\n## Company Overview and Founding History\n\n**Athena** is a provider of elite executive assistant services founded in **2019** by Jonathan Swanson and Robert Hayes. The company emerged from the founders' personal insight that talented executive assistants were their \"secret weapon\" in scaling previous ventures.\n\n### Founding Vision\n\n> **Core Insight**: Effective delegation and deep partnership with an assistant can dramatically multiply a leader's productivity.\n\n**Jonathan Swanson** previously co-founded Thumbtack, scaling it to over 1,000 employees and approximately $1 billion in volume. **Robert Hayes** served as COO of TaskUs, growing the outsourcing firm to 20,000+ employees under his operational leadership.\n\nThe genesis of Athena was uniquely personal—Swanson initially started the company to save jobs for former employees after a business transition, only to discover strong market demand for personal executive assistants. Athena officially launched in **2020** with a globally distributed model, positioning itself as a long-term partner to entrepreneurs, executives, and busy leaders.\n\n---\n\n## Business Model and Services\n\n### Core Service Architecture\n\nAthena operates on a **subscription-based model** with a distinctive value proposition:\n\n- **$3,000/month** flat fee for dedicated, full-time assistant\n- **One-to-one partnership**: Each client receives an exclusive Executive Partner working ~40+ hours per week\n- **Time-zone alignment** for seamless collaboration\n- **World-class delegation coaching** and support resources\n\n> **Key Differentiator**: Unlike gig-based platforms, Athena creates committed, long-term partnerships rather than transactional task fulfillment.\n\n### Service Portfolio\n\n**Administrative & Communication Tasks**\n- Email inbox management and correspondence drafting\n- Meeting scheduling and travel coordination  \n- Calendar maintenance and contact organization\n\n**Research, Reporting, and Operations**\n- Market research and insight compilation\n- Expense reporting and financial reconciliation\n- Workflow system development and documentation\n-

Landscape\n\n### Target Market and Value Proposition\n\nAthena positions itself at the **premium end** of the executive assistant market, targeting founders, CEOs, investors, and top professionals who view an EA as a productivity investment.\n\n> **Market Philosophy**: \"If you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant.\"\n\n**Cost Analysis**: At ~$36k annually, Athena argues cost-effectiveness compared to full-time in-person executive assistants in the U.S. (typically $60–100k plus overhead).\n\n### Competitive Differentiation\n\n**vs. Traditional In-House Executive Assistants**\n- Eliminates recruiting, HR, and training burdens\n- Provides talent pipeline and replacement guarantees\n- Offers systematic process playbooks and support networks\n\n**vs. Virtual Assistant Agencies**\n- Premium pricing for dedicated full-time partnership\n- Extreme selectivity (top 1% of global talent)\n- Comprehensive delegation coaching integration\n- *Trade-off*: Higher cost than fractional services like Double or Prialto\n\n**vs. On-Demand Task Services and AI**\n- Human relationship augmented by systems vs. purely transactional fulfillment\n- Strategic partnership model rather than task automation\n- *Positioning*: \"Not for everybody\"—targets users needing deep integration\n\n### Client Portfolio\n\nAthena's impressive client roster spans:\n- Early-stage tech startups to Fortune 100 corporations\n- Notable clients: Leaders at Airbnb, Meta, Uber\n- NBA team General Manager\n- U.S. state Governor  \n- World Series Poker champion\n\n---\n\n## Leadership and

No strict maximum observed.\\n    *   Preferred layover hubs often align with Star Alliance hubs (e.g., TPE, SIN, FRA, EWR, IAH, CLT).\\n*   **Direct vs. Connecting Flights:**\\n    *   Direct flights are taken when convenient and available.\\n    *   No specific rule for cost savings dictating connections, but the diverse airline choice suggests a balance of convenience, cost, and loyalty program benefits.\\n\\n## 5. Scheduling & Timings:\\n*   **Departure/Arrival Times:**\\n    *   No rigid preference; flight timings are diverse, including morning, afternoon, evening, and late-night (red-eye) departures for both domestic and international travel.\\n    *   Booking should be based on trip requirements and overall value rather than a strict time window.\\n*   **Day-of-Week Travel:**\\n    *   Travel occurs on all days of the week. No discernible pattern for preferred travel days.\\n\\n## 6. Booking Channels & Payment:\\n*   **Primary Booking Channels:**\\n    *   **Airline Direct Websites:** Most common method (United.com, AA.com, Singaporeair.com, AirAsia.com, etc.).\\n    *   **Travel Portals (often for points redemption):**\\n        *   Chase Travel / Chase Ultimate Rewards (for flights on AA, Asiana, UA).\\n        *   American Express Travel (for flights on UA, AA).\\n    *   **Other OTAs:** Occasionally used (e.g., DUGNY TRAVEL, Travel2be, CheapOair, Expedia, Orbitz).\\n*   **Payment Methods:**\\n    *   **Credit Cards:**\\n        *   Visa ending in 4020 (Primary)\\n        *   Visa ending in 7964\\n        *   Visa ending in 3889\\n        *   Visa ending in 8927\\n        *   Visa ending in 1810\\n        *   Visa ending in 8619\\n        *   Visa ending in 1648\\n        *   American Express ending in 1000\\n        *   American Express ending in 2008\\n    *   **Points/Miles (Heavily Utilized):**\\n        *   **United MileagePlus:** Primary program for redeeming on UA and Star Alliance partners.\\n        *   **American AAdvantage:** Secondary program, often redeemed via Chase Travel or direct.\\n        *   **Chase Ultimate Rewards points.**\\n        *   **Air France/KLM Flying Blue.**\\n        *   **Aeroplan.**\\n    *   Cash co-pays with miles bookings are common and typically low.\\n\\n## 7. Cost Considerations & Price Ranges:\\n*   **Price Sensitivity:**\\n    *   Demonstrates price awareness by using LCCs for certain routes and utilizing points/miles extensively for premium cabin travel.\\n    *   Willing to pay for ancillary services like preferred seats on LCCs or full-service carriers in Economy.\\n*   **Balancing Cost vs. Convenience/Comfort:**\\n    *   Prioritizes Star Alliance benefits and premium cabins for long-haul, often achieved cost-effectively through miles.\\n    *   For shorter flights or regional travel, cost (LCCs) and directness seem to play a larger role.\\n    *   No fixed budget constraints are evident, but a value-driven approach is observed.\\n\\n## 8. Ancillary Services & Loyalty:\\n*   **Meal Requests:**\\n    *   **Vegetarian Meal:** Specifically \"Vegetarian Value Pack meal\" requested on AirAsia flights. Consider proactively asking if a vegetarian meal is preferred on other LCCs or Asian carriers.\\n    *   \"Standard meal\" or \"Any meal\" has also been noted, suggesting flexibility unless a specific vegetarian option is available and desired.\\n*   **Baggage Requirements:**\\n    *   **At least one (1) checked bag is typically required, usually 2 unless otherwise stated. For larger airlines, 1 checked bag (40L, 20-30kg) and one large carry-on (30-35L, 15-25kg) is typically used. ** Allowances vary by airline and fare class (e.g., 23kg, 30kg, 40kg, 2 bags).\\n    *   On LCCs where baggage is extra, it is usually purchased (e.g., 20kg or 30kg).\\n    *   Ensure baggage allowance is adequate for the trip length and type.\\n*   **Frequent Flyer Programs (Always Add to Bookings):**\\n    *   **United MileagePlus:** XXXXX463 (or YT991463) - Primary\\n    *   **American AAdvantage:** 598KCU8 (or 598****)\\n    *   **Delta SkyMiles:** ******550\\n    *   **JetBlue TrueBlue (B6):** 3033066531\\n    *   **Air France/KLM Flying Blue:** 005053616093\\n    *   **EVA Air:** 1308084072\\n    *   **Southwest Rapid Rewards:** 22193948464\\n    *   **Spirit Free Spirit:** 305654985\\n    *   **Lufthansa Miles & More:** (Number masked, confirm if still active)\\n*   **Known Traveler Number (KTN):**\\n    *   **Always add KTN: 984591159** to eligible bookings for TSA PreCheck.\\n\\n## 9. Critical Mandates & Restrictions:\\n*   **Must-Haves:**\\n    *   Correct Frequent Flyer numbers applied to all bookings.\\n    *   Known Traveler Number (984591159) applied to all eligible bookings.\\n    *   Aisle seat whenever possible.\\n    *   Adequate checked baggage allowance.\\n    *   For AirAsia flights, book \"Vegetarian Value Pack meal.\"\\n*   **Name for Booking:**\\n    *   The legal name on travel documents should be paramount. Records show variations:\\n        *   \"Christopher York\"\\n        *   \"Christopheranthony York\" (often for UA, possibly as first name \"Christopheranthony\", last name \"York\")\\n        *   \"Christopher Anthony York\" (middle name included)\\n    *   **Verify and use the exact name as it appears on the passport for all bookings.** \"Christopher Anthony York\" is likely the full legal name.\\n\\n## 10. Other Actionable Insights:\\n*   **Flexibility & Changes:** Several bookings show evidence of changes or rescheduling. Be prepared for potential itinerary adjustments.\\n*   **Travel with Companions:** While this SOP focuses on the client's individual preferences, be aware that they occasionally travel with others. Companion preferences are not covered here.\\n*   **Booking Lead Time:** Highly variable. Bookings are made from a few days to several months in advance.\\n*   **International Focus:** A significant portion of travel is international, spanning North America, Europe, and Asia. This necessitates attention to visa requirements, passport validity, and international airline partners.\\n*   **Currency Awareness:** Bookings are made in various currencies (USD, IDR, EUR, CA$, GBP, THB, MYR, CHF, BRL). Be mindful of this when comparing prices or processing payments.",

Duration 60 min.\n\n**Team Structures & Reporting Lines:**\n*   Clear reporting line from EA (Aly Apelado) to Chris.\n*   Athena internal collaborations (e.g., with Haider, Kevin Rath, Carlos, and teams in PwC meeting like Lynn Baile, Telle Bitang, Grace Hicban, Jardine Miroy) suggest a matrix or project-based team structure within Athena, where Chris is a senior member or lead.\n*   External collaborations are typically direct (Chris + external partner) or small, focused groups.\n\n**External vs. Internal Collaboration Balance:**\n*   Strong emphasis on external collaboration, constituting a majority of his scheduled professional interaction time. These are often strategic and intensive.\n*   Internal collaboration focuses on Athena's operational needs, EA management, and specific project deliverables.\n\n## 3. WORK PATTERNS & PRACTICES\n\n**Deep Work Methodology:**\n*   Blocks significant, multi-hour chunks for deep work, especially for strategic external collaborations (e.g., 6-8 hour sessions with Coreline Ventures, Irrational Labs). \"JS Cowork Day\" (7 hrs) also indicates this.\n*   Utilizes self-scheduled \"DNS\" (assumed Do Not Disturb) blocks of 60-120 minutes for focused, individual work.\n*   Often conducts deep work sessions in dedicated environments like cafes or co-working spaces when traveling (e.g., Awaken Cafe, Temescal Works in Oakland).\n\n**Meeting Preparation Rituals & Follow-up Patterns:**\n*   Explicitly schedules travel time to/from in-person meetings, indicating advance planning.\n*   Uses Apple Notes to store details for appointments (seen for personal, likely extends to professional), suggesting a system for information capture.\n*   Events like \"Hold for SS Call\" (2 hours before a call with Samuel Salzer) might represent dedicated preparation time.\n*   The level of detail in travel planning (e.g. flight check-ins, ground transport) implies a structured approach that likely extends to meeting prep.\n\n**Decision-Making Forums & Processes:**\n*   Strategic decisions with external partners likely occur during the intensive 1:1 work sessions.\n*   Functional and project-specific decisions happen in group settings (e.g., \"Athena/PwC Tax - Functional Discussion\").\n*   Internal Athena decisions are likely made in 1:1s with key colleagues (e.g., Haider Sabri) or small team meetings.\n\n**Learning/Development Activities:**\n*   Proactively engages in continuous learning: attends industry events (CPO Summit), specialized coaching (\"Vibe Coursing\"), and numerous AI-focused webinars.\n*   This demonstrates a commitment to staying current, particularly in AI and product leadership.\n\n**Personal Productivity Systems Evident in Calendar:**\n*   Meticulous calendar usage: blocks time for meetings, deep work, travel, personal appointments, and even logistical steps like \"Check-in\" or \"Customs & Immigration.\"\n*   Leverages an Executive Assistant (Athena service) for scheduling and support, with regular check-in meetings.\n*   Uses personal blocks like \"DNS\" for focus.\n*   Integrates external links (Apple Notes, Zoom, Maps) directly into calendar events for efficiency.\n\n**Travel Patterns & Remote/In-Person Work Balance:**\n*   Highly mobile professional with extensive international travel. Recent data shows a base in Bali, Indonesia (Feb-Mar '25), with significant work trips to San Francisco/Oakland (Jan-Feb '25, Sep '24 for meetings and CPO Summit), Puerto Rico (multiple visits in late 2024, possibly a previous base or frequent work location), and shorter trips like Taipei (Aug '24).\n*   A hybrid work model: many virtual meetings (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) interspersed with periods of intense in-person collaboration requiring travel.\n*   In-person meetings often involve longer, more immersive sessions.\n\n**Strategic Thinking Time Allocation:**\n*   The long, dedicated sessions with strategic partners (Kaneko, Berman), \"DNS\" blocks, and events like \"New VC Fund AI Ops Co-Working Session\" strongly indicate substantial time allocated to strategic thinking, planning, and high-level problem-solving.\n\n## 4. TEMPORAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n**Energy Management Patterns Throughout Day/Week:**\n*   Manages energy by interspersing intense work periods (long strategic sessions, cross-time-zone calls, travel) with regular personal wellness activities (massages, fitness classes like \"Side Splits\" and \"Press Handstand\" at Nirvana Life in Bali, spa visits in Puerto Rico).\n*   Schedules meal deliveries (\"Macro Meals Delivery Window\"), suggesting a focus on maintaining routine and health even with a busy schedule.\n*   Calendar shows flexibility to work early mornings or late evenings to accommodate global time zones, particularly when in Asia/Europe connecting with US contacts.\n\n**Scheduling Preferences for Different Activity Types:**\n*   External calls with US/Europe often fall in his early morning or late evening when he is in an Asian time zone (+08:00).\n*   Deep work sessions with external partners can be full-day affairs.\n*   Personal wellness activities (fitness, massage) are frequently scheduled in the late afternoon or early evening (local time).\n*   Travel days are fully blocked out with meticulous scheduling for each logistic step.\n\n**Protected Times & Boundaries:**\n*   \"DNS\" blocks are clear indicators of protected time for focused work.\n*   While work occurs on some weekend days (based on event local time), there's also dedicated personal time.\n*   Regular use of an EA helps manage his schedule and likely protects his time.\n\n**Seasonal Workload Variations:**\n*   The provided sample (mainly ~9 months) shows a consistently high level of activity. Jan-Feb 2025 appears particularly intense with travel to the US and back-to-back strategic meetings. Insufficient data for definitive annual seasonal trends, but Q1 2025 starts strong.\n\n**Response to High-Pressure Periods:**\n*   High-pressure periods like international travel are managed with detailed pre-planning visible in the calendar.\n*   The consistent scheduling of wellness activities throughout busy periods suggests this is a key strategy for managing stress and maintaining high performance.\n\n## 5. SUPPORT OPTIMIZATION (Specific Strategies for Assistants)\n\n*   **Master Proactive Travel Orchestration:** Given frequent, complex international travel, anticipate and meticulously manage all logistics: flights, ground transport (with map links and contact details), airport procedures (check-in windows, lounge access), accommodation details. Always confirm addresses and have backup plans. Build in buffer time.\n*   **Become a Vigilant Time Zone Guardian:** Excel at managing and clearly communicating schedules across multiple international time zones (Bali, various US zones, Europe, etc.). Double-check all meeting invites for correct time zone displays.\n*   **Champion Deep Work Blocks:** Understand the importance of \"DNS\" and long strategic work sessions. Proactively defend this time by gatekeeping, batching communications, and minimizing interruptions. Help identify optimal locations if in-person sessions are needed during travel.\n*   **Streamline Meeting Lifecycle Management:**\n    *   Prep: For key strategic meetings, inquire if pre-reading or agenda points can be compiled. Ensure all tech (Zoom links, etc.) is tested and accessible. Block out prep time if hinted (e.g., \"Hold for Call\").\n    *   Logistics: Ensure meeting locations (virtual or physical) are clear and all attendees have necessary information.\n    *   Follow-up: Potentially assist in tracking action items or scheduling follow-on discussions emerging from key meetings.\n*   **Integrate Wellness and Personal Logistics:** Recognize the high priority placed on wellness (fitness, massage, meal services). Help seamlessly integrate these into the schedule, especially during travel or intense work sprints. Manage bookings for these personal appointments if requested.\n*   **Support Learning & Development:** Track interesting webinars, conferences, or courses based on his interests (AI, product, leadership). Assist with registration, calendar blocking, and material organization.\n*   **Manage Recurring Cadences:** Ensure all recurring meetings (EA check-ins, key contact syncs, potentially personal service bookings like meal delivery) are consistently scheduled and adjusted for travel.\n*   **Information Hub Management:** Maintain a clean and efficient system for notes and key information, leveraging his preference for Apple Notes or suggesting improvements. Ensure critical details are always embedded or linked in calendar invites.\n*   **Anticipate Needs for International Operations:** For activities like the Italian visa/legal matters (Studio Mazzeschi), proactively track deadlines, required documents, and necessary appointments.\n*   **Communication Triage:** During his focus times or travel, offer to triage incoming communications, flagging urgent items and summarizing others for his later review.",

Carlos Lucero is the primary internal contact for operational matters specific to Chris's activities. Roughly 60% External (VC/Partners/Vendors) vs. 40% Internal (Athena team).\\n\\n## Work Methodology & Operational Patterns\\n\\n*   **Problem-Solving & Decision-Making:** Chris's approach is highly analytical and direct. He seeks necessary information (e.g., screenshots for Airtable flows, clarification on API parameters, tax regulations) and provides detailed, often critical, feedback. Decisions are communicated clearly and concisely.\\n    *   *Example (Airtable Feedback):* \"The difference between a base and its app, which by the way is actually called an \"interface\" rather than an \"app\" in their actual UI, is a little confusing.\"\\n    *   *Example (AI Tool Feedback):* \"I much prefer copying something in the \"wrong\" format and then using a chatbot to reformat it, whether in a spreadsheet or document. ... It seems vaguely useful if you can get it to work... but there is no key use case that it really excels at...\"\\n    *   *Example (Vendor Communication):* \"It has not been marked delivered in ECM. It was reported delivered by UPS a week ago. By your logic, it should be in ECM already. Let me know if the package is lost or was never received.\"\\n    *   *Example (Scheduling):* \"Let's proceed.\"\\n    *   *Example (AI Tool Evaluation):* \"In my experience, chatbots or GPTs generally do not create much value or see significant usage once built.\"\\n*   **Information Processing & Management:** Chris prefers information to be structured and relevant. He uses and shares links to documents (Google Docs, Pitch), spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Airtable), and workflow platforms (n8n). He appreciates summarized information but also dives into technical details. He delegates information gathering and processing tasks to his EA and AI workflows.\\n    *   *Example (Sharing Information):* \"Below are some links for those 3 topics, to at least get you some context in the interim.\"\\n    *   *Example (Requesting Information):* \"Do you have screenshots of all the onboarding, sharing, app creation, etc flows being referred to?\"\\n    *   *Example (Automated Information Processing):* \"Carlos built an automation that has an LLM read each chapter and summarize it + extract quotes.\"\\n*   **Productivity & Tools:** Chris heavily relies on and actively evaluates a wide range of AI and automation tools. He mentions or uses:\\n    *   Automation Platforms: n8n (self-hosted), Zapier, Gumloop, Bardeen, Make, Lindy\\n    *   AI Models/Tools: OpenAI (ChatGPT, GPT-4o mini), Claude (Sonnet 3.5), Gemini (Pro 2.5), R1, Perplexity, Sora, Exa, Tavily, Ottogrid, Hearth.ai, Day.ai, Lex, Sparkle, Spiral\\n    *   App Building AI: Bolt.new, Lovable, v0, Rork, Tempo, Replit, Cursor, Windsurf\\n    *   Data/Scraping/Research: Airtable, Google Sheets (Sheets GPT Extension), Spider.cloud, Firecrawl, LlamaParse, Clay\\n    *   Content/Media AI: Suno (audio), Fal.ai (Kling for video), HeyGen/Tavus (deepfakes/video avatars), Scenario AI, Retro Diffusion\\n    *   Project Management/Collaboration: Asana, Google Docs, Pitch, Loom, Figma\\n    *   Financial/Legal: Carta, DocuSign, Box, Stripe, PayPal, Earth Class Mail, Popular.com, Etrends Group (SURI, FinCEN, Act 22)\\n    *   He is particular about tool usability and value proposition (\"Too much of the interface exists only in human memory,\" \"no key use case that it really excels at\"). He leverages his EA to manage interactions with many of these tools and vendors.\\n*   **Professional Persona:** Based on the emails, Chris's professional demeanor is direct, analytical, results-oriented, and visionary (especially regarding AI). He is a \"productivity hacker\" and \"deep thinker about delegation.\" He provides blunt, honest feedback but is also collaborative and supportive (e.g., helping Ann with her app, providing detailed feedback to Irrational Labs). He expresses urgency when needed (\"since this is time-sensitive\"). He delegates effectively and empowers his EA to handle significant responsibilities.\\n\\n## Actionable Recommendations for EA & AI Support\\n\\nThe following recommendations are tailored for a new Executive Assistant and the configuration of AI support systems for Chris York:\\n\\n**EA Onboarding & Day-to-Day Focus:**\\n\\n1.  **#1 Priority: Calendar Management and Meeting Coordination:** Chris travels frequently across different time zones (Bali, PST, EST, etc.) and relies heavily on his EA to coordinate meetings. The complexity of managing his schedule and accommodating various stakeholders' time zones is paramount for immediate EA effectiveness. Carlos has consistently managed this, often proposing specific time slots across time zones and coordinating invites (\"Chris is in Bali so time zones may be a little tricky, but here are a few time slots that work for Chris next week,\" \"Chris is super booked next week, but we can do Wednesday...\").\\n2.  **Vendor Communication & Task Management:** A significant portion of communication involves managing interactions with external vendors for services, tools, and compliance. The EA should triage and manage these threads, escalating only when Chris's specific input or decision is required. This includes tax/compliance firms (Etrends Group), financial/equity platforms (Carta), mail services (Earth Class Mail), banking (Popular.com), and AI tool vendors (Bright Data, TexAu, ElevenLabs, Prisma, Ocean.io, Hearth.ai, Day.ai, Spiral). The EA should become familiar with recurring contacts and processes (e.g., tax filing cycles, dealing with Carta issues, mail forwarding).\\n3.  **Information Curation & Summarization:** Chris shares and receives information in various formats (docs, sheets, links). The EA should assist in organizing and summarizing key information, especially from longer threads or external documents/links, to save Chris time. This includes tasks like creating AI summaries of content (\"Carlos built an automation that has an LLM read each chapter and summarize it + extract quotes\").\\n4.  **Drafting Routine Correspondence:** The EA should draft responses to routine emails, vendor confirmations, and scheduling communications, mirroring Chris's concise and direct style where appropriate, or maintaining a professional tone for external service providers. Carlos's emails provide good examples of typical responses to vendors and scheduling requests.\\n5.  **Managing Task Tracking Systems (Asana, Airtable):** Ensure tasks are correctly logged and tracked, including statuses (in progress, blocked) if Chris/collaborators provide that information. The EA should proactively chase updates from others if needed for reporting purposes (as inferred from the discussion about Asana reporting).\\n\\n**Types of Emails/Tasks for EA Management/Triage/Drafting:**\\n\\n*   Scheduling requests and follow-ups.\\n*   Routine vendor inquiries and confirmations (e.g., tax document requests, payment confirmations, service updates).\\n*   Initial responses to sales outreach from tool vendors.\\n*   Problem reports for software/services, following established formats if available (like the Firecrawl bug report).\\n*   Requesting/providing standard documentation.\\n*   Following up on outstanding requests (payments, document delivery, information).\\n\\n**Preferred Methods for Task Delegation or Updates to User:**\\n\\n*   Delegation to Carlos is primarily via email, often with links to relevant documents or brief instructions.\\n*   Updates from Carlos to Chris often include summaries or key details, along with links to shared documents or platforms (Google Sheets, Pitch, n8n workflows, Asana).\\n*   For important project updates from collaborators, Chris prefers structured information and clear context (\"Riva Corp Dev Deck Needs\" outline, \"Investment Memo\" structure).\\n\\n**Proactive Support Opportunities:**\\n\\n*   **Chasing Overdue Responses:** Proactively follow up on emails sent by Chris or Carlos that require a response or action from others, especially when deadlines are mentioned (e.g., tax documents, scheduling confirmations, vendor issue resolutions).\\n*   **Summarizing Threads:** For long or complex email threads that require Chris's attention, provide a concise summary of the key points, decisions, and outstanding action items.\\n*   **Information Gathering/Verification:** Assist with gathering information requested by Chris or needed for projects (e.g., finding screenshots of workflows, looking up documentation). Verify information received from vendors (e.g., checking Merchant Certificate status in SURI).\\n*   **Workflow Monitoring:** Monitor automated workflows (especially those Chris or Carlos has built in tools like n8n) for errors or successful completion, reporting status to Chris.\\n*   **Tool Evaluation Assistance:** Assist in setting up accounts or accessing trials for new AI/automation tools Chris wants to evaluate (e.g., Hearth.ai, Day.ai, Paradigm AI). Handle basic onboarding steps and report initial impressions or technical hurdles.\\n\\n**AI Configuration Style Guide:**\\n\\n*   **Tone and Style:**\\n    *   **Formal/External (Vendors, New Contacts):** Professional, courteous, clear, and concise.\\n        *   *Example Phrases:* \"Hi [Name],\" \"Best regards,\" \"Thank you for reaching out.\"\\n        *   *Carlos Lucero Example:* \"Hi Ignacio, Appreciate all of the updates provided. Upon review of this new regulation, it seems pretty straightforward to file the initial report so we'll go ahead and process this ourselves. ... Thanks again for all the help! Best, Carlos Lucero\"\\n    *   **Informal/Internal (Close Collaborators like Jonathan, Haider, Eliot):** More relaxed tone, direct, can use exclamation points or colloquialisms.\\n        *   *Example Phrases:* \"Heyo,\" \"Cheers,\" \"Thanks man!\"\\n        *   *Chris York Example:* \"Hey,\" \"Thanks!,\" \"--Chris\". Often uses bullet points or numbered lists for clear communication.\\n    *   **Vendor/Support Interactions (Chris):** Direct, specific about the issue, often includes detailed context or proposed solutions, can be blunt if frustrated.\\n        *   *Example Phrases:* \"Hi,\" \"Thanks!,\" \"--Chris\"\\n        *   *Chris York Example:* \"I uploaded a fucking photo of a transaction as per the instructions, as it is a digital card.\" (Note: This example from a support thread shows a frustration level, but might be too blunt for typical AI drafting. A more measured but still direct tone is preferred for routine AI interactions). \"We are not doing a call. Send API pricing for US data. Thanks! —Chris\"\\n*   **Structure:** Prefer bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when providing information or outlining points. Keep paragraphs relatively concise.\\n*   **Content:** Focus on providing necessary information efficiently. Avoid excessive pleasantries or unnecessary detail. Include links to relevant documents or external resources where appropriate.\\n*   **Signature:** Use the \"—Chris\" sign-off for emails directly from Chris York (c@chrisyork.co). For emails drafted on behalf of Chris by an EA or AI, the signature \"Carlos Lucero, Executive Assistant to Chris York\" is the established format. The AI should likely use the EA's signature when drafting on behalf of the EA.\\n*   **AI Drafting Guidelines:**\\n    *   Draft routine replies to vendors asking for confirmation or providing standard information.\\n    *   Draft scheduling emails based on provided availability.\\n    *   Draft initial acknowledgments to new contacts based on templates.\\n    *   Flag emails requiring Chris's direct attention (e.g., complex problems, strategic decisions, introductions requiring his personal touch, requests for detailed feedback on new concepts).\\n    *   When drafting for the EA, ensure the tone is professional and service-oriented, including the EA's standard signature block.\\n\\n*(Inference: Chris's preferred salutation for close contacts appears to be \"Hey\" or \"Hi,\" while for external/new contacts or vendors, it is \"Hi\" or \"Dear [Name]\").*\\n*(Inference: Chris is comfortable using different email addresses for different contexts (c@chrisyork.co, chris@therealchrisyork.com, chrisyork@athena.com, chris@cognitivedigital.com), which suggests flexibility in identity presentation, though c@chrisyork.co appears to be his primary professional address).*\\n*(Inference: Chris values prompt responses and clear communication, particularly from service providers and collaborators on urgent tasks or issues).*\\n\\nThis profile serves as a starting point and should be adapted as the EA learns Chris's evolving preferences and work habits.\t",

Structure & Formatting:** Uses brief paragraphs and lists (often bullet points) to convey information efficiently. Includes links to relevant documents, tools, or workflows. May reply directly within the quoted text.\\n    *   Example: Lists technical details and notes about the daily report workflow using bullet points:\\n        *   \"We have not added the AI suggested follow up tasks yet, but will have that in there soon.\"\\n        *   \"We were not able to see in the Asana API how your EAs mark when a task is started. Usually there is a section in a given project called 'in progress' or something like that, but many people don't use it and only mark tasks complete. You may have to have your EAs change their MO and move all tasks to an 'in progress' section when they start it, otherwise we can't compute things like 'how long has this task been in progress'.\"\\n        *   \"Things you may want to provide input on:\" (followed by bulleted list of questions)\\n*   **D.

Expresses enthusiasm for connecting and sharing information.\\n    *   Example: \"Awesome jamming yesterday.\"\\n    *   Example: \"It would be great to catch up! I was just thinking about you, actually, because I was texting with Byron and Vittorio.\"\\n    *   Example: \"Glad you like it! We're excited about the potential.\"\\n*   **C. Structure & Formatting:** Uses paragraphs and sometimes lists for ideas or resources. May include links. Replies can be lengthy when discussing complex topics.\\n    *   Example: Shares detailed ideas on the Athena community fund using bullet points and paragraphs:\\n        *   \"As far as the community fund goes, I will write something up that's more detailed, but I think the simple version is we have a two choices. The first could be a stepping stone to the second, or just an alternative.\" (followed by numbered list)\\n        *   \"Without getting into too much of the minutiae (e.g. investor committee / deal selection or fee terms), the basic idea is we have a relatively lean, high-volume operation that generates decent cashflow from just the SPV or management fees, with some potentially very interesting upside even at fairly friendly carry terms.\"\\n*   **D. Common Phrases or Idiosyncrasies:** Uses phrases like \"jamming,\" \"trade notes,\" \"flesh out,\" \"crawl-walk-run phasing.\" Frequently uses \"--Chris\" sign-off. May mention travel context.\\n    *   Example: \"Hey Luke, great to be connected. Human Intelligence looks super interesting, and it's engaging in a problem space we've been exploring a lot at Athena and in my own personal AI projects.

Communication Patterns The User Seems to Avoid:** Avoids overly casual language or excessive personal details unless directly relevant to scheduling or context (e.g., travel).\\n*   **F. Closing & Sign-off:** Typically uses \"--Chris\".\\n\\n### Initiating Threads vs. Replying\\n\\n*   **Initiating Threads:** Emails sent to initiate a conversation or report an issue tend to be more detailed, providing necessary context and background information upfront. They often include lists of specific points, questions, or supporting evidence (links, images).\\n    *   Example (Initiating to Vendor): \"I want to report a problem with Firecrawl Deep Research. It doesn't follow the JSON parameters we set. While not 100% sure if there is an error on our end or legitimate bug with API, we've checked everything on our end and found no reason we're the ones causing this issue.\" (followed by bullet points and images)\\n    *   Example (Initiating to Internal Peer): \"Did some quick experiments with R1. These are first drafts (i.e. one shot prompts, no complex prompt chain with an editor in the loop or anything). The writing is really good—it's at times legitimately funny, coins clever neologisms, and crafts savvy metaphors with astute, surprising references.\" (followed by links)\\n    *   Example (Initiating to Professional Network): \"I am reaching out to request your assistance in locating and obtaining an extract of a birth certificate in international format (with details of both maternity and paternity) for the following individual:\" (followed by details and links)\\n*   **Replying:** Replies are often significantly shorter and more direct. They may be a simple acknowledgment, a confirmation, a direct answer to a question, or a brief follow-up question. In rapid exchanges, replies can be extremely concise.\\n    *   Example (Reply to Vendor): \"Seems to be fixed in the latest version. I'll let you know if the same issue crops up again.\"\\n    *   Example (Reply to Vendor): \"Confirmed.\"\\n    *   Example (Reply to Internal Peer): \"Yeah it was like a quick 30 min thing we whipped together today as a POC.\"\\n    *   Example (Reply to Professional Network): \"Great. Just grabbed a time slot. Looking forward to it!\"\\n    *   Replies are lengthy when providing detailed feedback or exploring complex ideas sparked by the previous message, often structured with points referencing the original email.\\n        *   Example (Lengthy Reply to Collaborator): \"In my experience, chatbots or GPTs generally do not create much value or see significant usage once built. There are a few exceptions, e.g. customer support and HR, but I would characterize these as medium cost (mostly the non-AI elements like data access/cleaning + compliance) and very low likely value.\" (followed by detailed analysis of project ideas)\\n\\n### Handling Disagreements or Delivering Difficult News\\n\\nChris York is direct when disagreeing or delivering difficult news, providing specific reasons and observations to support his stance. While direct, the tone can be softened with phrases like \"I think\" or focusing on objective observations (\"seems odd\"). With his EA, the tone is blunt when performance is significantly below expectations.\\n\\n*   Example (Disagreement/Negative Feedback to Vendor): \"That doesn't seem to make sense. We are passing the handles exactly as they are from the URL (e.g. linkedin.com/in/handle).\"\\n*   Example (Critical Feedback to Internal Party *about* EA): \"I would rate it at about a 1/10, with 1 also being my estimate for how many hours she's worked per week in the past month or two. Basically, she has not completed a single task correctly in that period.\"\\n*   Example (Critical Feedback on Product Design): \"Shoving someone in the app UI before they have seen the real product will only 1) cause confusion, 2) increase churn, and 3) reduce every other metric they claim to care about, since most of the actions related to those metrics are not even accessible there. Even in cases where you can actually do something in the app UI, the button is often in a different place (e.g. the share button is top right in the data UI vs bottom left the app UI).\"\\n\\n### Providing Positive Feedback\\n\\nChris York's positive feedback is often brief and focused on the value or quality of the work or idea, rather than effusive praise. It can be implied through quick agreement or appreciation of shared information.\\n\\n*   Example (Acknowledgment of good work/progress): \"Thanks!\"\\n    *   Example: \"Thanks! --Chris\"\\n*   Example (Appreciation of shared information): \"Some research we did that might be interesting to you for growth/marketing.\" (Subject: Passionfroot & Paved Scrape)\\n    *   Example: \"Sharing in case interesting to you.\" (Subject: AI Summary of New Reid Hoffman Book, Superagency)\\n*   Example (Acknowledging good work by team): \"Glad you like it! We're excited about the potential.\"\\n*   Example (Implicit positive feedback by agreement): \"100% agree\"\\n\\n### Providing Negative Feedback\\n\\nNegative feedback is direct and specific, often pointing to flaws in logic, execution, or perceived value. It is delivered in a functional tone, focused on identifying problems and suggesting areas for improvement or alternative approaches.\\n\\n*   Example (Feedback on Vendor Service): \"It's not letting me export it.\"\\n*   Example (Feedback on Product Feature): \"Probably 60% of the time I want to edit a set’s weight, I edit the rest timer instead. Super annoying. I wish I could disable per set timers even being editable on the workout tracking screen, or have to long press it or something.\"\\n*   Example (Feedback on Airtable Product/UX): \"It's a little tricky since we've listed many behaviors for each behavior, and there's already 5 of them. Inside of some of the 5, we've listed 2-4 sub-behaviors that are actually quite different (e.g. simple and advanced actions, or completing onboarding vs building an app). It's a little bit hard to address all of these, and I feel like they could benefit from more focus on which of the specific behaviors matter and which ones are really just a consequence of the others (e.g. sharing and upgrading).\"\\n*   Example (Feedback on AI tool): \"I haven’t been impressed. Also if you intercept the api calls to the LLMs it seems like their prompts are very basic / poor and they reuse the same prompt for a lot of different spirals.\"\\n\\n### Asking For Feedback/Advice\\n\\nRequests for feedback or advice are direct and specify the area of input needed. He indicates what type of information he is sharing for review and may pose specific questions.\\n\\n*   Example (Asking for feedback on workflow outputs): \"Example output from OSS scraper AI... Let us know your thoughts and Carlos can help customize it.\"\\n*   Example (Asking for clarification/guidance on vendor process): \"Is your recommendation to upload poor quality original audio to Eleven Labs, so that we're able to match it exactly with the live recording for verification?\"\\n*   Example (Asking for specific input on project ideas): \"If there was some other type of feedback you were looking for, let me know and I can try to weigh in from that perspective.\"\\n*   Example (Asking for specific examples): \"If you can share examples of the most viral or best-performing content so far from your work or related accounts, that would be helpful to help us orient the LLMs on extracting the best content and turning mundane quotes into useful final assets.\"\\n\\n### Asking For Favors\\n\\nRequests for help or assistance are direct. When asking vendors, the request is framed around resolving an issue or accessing a paid service. When asking contacts in his professional network, it is framed collaboratively or in terms of mutual benefit (\"Would love to trade notes\"). Delegation to his EA is direct instruction.\\n\\n*   Example (Request to Vendor for help): \"Can you delete the voice clone so I can try it with worse quality / pre-production audio?\"\\n*   Example (Request to Vendor for info/access): \"I recently bought an annual subscription for the Pro plan and I'd like to start testing out the API. Would you be able to give me access to all of the API endpoints? (Smart, Research, News, Search), and anything else that might be relevant to take full advantage of my purchase?\"\\n*   Example (Request to Professional Network): \"Would love to trade notes, hear what you've discovered so far, and learn more about your vision.\"\\n*   Example (Request to Professional Network for scheduling): \"You can text me or WhatsApp me anytime in the next 3 hours and I will pop up a Zoom. +1-631-902-6481 wa.me/+16319026481\"\\n*   Example (Instruction to EA/Scheduling tool): \"Find a time for us\"",
          "context_google_drive_files": "The user is a strategic operator and advisor working at the intersection of Behavioral Science, AI, and the Venture Capital/Tech ecosystem. Their role involves developing and applying AI/LLMs for product innovation, workflow automation, research, and prompt engineering.

They also consume and reference many documents shared by others in their network.\\n\\n**How and where specifically can an AI assistant help (non-obvious/creative uses):**\\n*   **Behavioral Science-Enhanced Prompt Optimization:** An AI assistant could analyze and suggest improvements to prompts for LLMs (e.g., for `App System Prompts Research` or `Athena_Gmail_Query_Feedback`) by applying behavioral science principles (nudging, framing, reducing cognitive load) to enhance their effectiveness and user experience. It could also generate diverse prompt variations based on these principles for A/B testing.\\n*   **Proactive \"Weak Signal\" Detection for VC/Market Trends:** Beyond basic news aggregation, an AI could monitor a wide array of unconventional sources (e.g., niche forums, academic pre-print servers, discussions in open-source communities related to `Powerset OSS Hub`) to identify early, \"weak signals\" of emerging technologies, talent movements, or market shifts relevant to their investment theses or product strategies. It could then synthesize these into concise, actionable insights.\\n*   **Automated Generation of \"Pre-Mortem\" Scenarios for New Ventures:** For new ideas like \"Superchat V1 Ideas,\" an AI could generate a set of potential failure points or \"pre-mortem\" scenarios based on common startup pitfalls, behavioral biases in decision-making, and competitive landscapes, prompting deeper strategic thinking early on.\\n*   **Cross-Pollination Catalyst for Projects:** Given their involvement in multiple ventures (Athena, Powerset, Superchat), an AI could analyze key documents (or summaries) from each project to identify non-obvious thematic overlaps, reusable technical components, or strategic insights that could be leveraged across different initiatives, fostering innovation and efficiency. For example, an approach used in `Powerset - GitHub Repo Filtering` might inspire a solution for `Client Context Extraction via LLMs Project | Athena`.\\n*   **Intelligent Onboarding Content Personalization:** For `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`, an AI could help tailor onboarding materials or sequences for new clients/users by analyzing pre-provided client context (if available and permissioned), adapting the information and examples to be most relevant to their specific industry, role, or stated goals.\\n\\n**5 Most Important File Types (by purpose) with Recent Examples:**\\n1.  **AI Model/Product Feedback & Specification Documents:** Documents detailing requirements, feedback, or performance analysis for AI-driven features or products.\\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Search Queries V1_o3 Feedback + Suggestions`\\n2.  **Market & Company Intelligence Aggregators (Spreadsheets/CSVs):** Central repositories for tracking startups, market trends, competitive data, or recruitment targets.\\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Powerset Eng Recruiting`\\n3.  **Workflow Automation & Data Management Blueprints (often represented by tracking spreadsheets):** Systems and databases (like those tracked in `n8n Workflows - Synced` or `Airtable Bases & Tables`) that are crucial for operational efficiency and data integrity.\\n    *   *Recent Example:* `n8n Workflows - Synced` (as a proxy for the automated workflows it logs)\\n4.  **New Venture/Product Ideation Hubs (Spreadsheets/Documents):** Files used for brainstorming, outlining, and planning new products, features, or strategic initiatives.\\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Superchat V1 Ideas`\\n5.  **Process & Operational Excellence Guides (Documents):** Documents establishing standard operating procedures, defining key processes, or outlining artifacts for client/team management.\\n    *   *Recent Example:* `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`\\n\\n**New, non-basic or non-obvious AI workflows most beneficial:**\\n1.  **AI-Driven Behavioral Audit & Redesign Suggestions:**\\n    *   **Workflow:** User provides product mockups, marketing copy, or user flow diagrams (e.g., from Athena's onboarding).\\n    *   **AI Action:** An AI trained on a comprehensive library of behavioral science principles analyzes the materials for adherence to or violation of these principles (e.g., identifying choice overload, lack of clear feedback loops, missed opportunities for social proof).\\n    *   **Output:** A report with specific, actionable recommendations on how to redesign elements to improve user engagement, decision-making, or task completion, citing the relevant behavioral principles. For instance, \"Consider reframing option X using the decoy effect to nudge users towards option Y,\" or \"The current sign-up process can be improved by incorporating the endowed progress effect.\"\\n2.  **Proactive \"Expert System\" for VC Due Diligence & Sourcing:**\\n    *   **Workflow:** User defines key investment criteria (market, team attributes, tech stack, behavioral indicators of product-market fit, drawing from `Powerset` activities and research like `CRM Enrichment Platforms`).\\n    *   **AI Action:** AI continuously scours diverse data sources (company databases, LinkedIn, GitHub, product reviews, news, patent filings). It not only identifies potential investment targets but also constructs a preliminary \"mini-thesis\" for each, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, unique differentiators (especially behavioral hooks), and potential risks, along with a confidence score. It could also identify individuals whose profiles match `Powerset Eng Recruiting` needs within these target companies.\\n    *   **Output:** A prioritized feed of investment opportunities with synthesized initial due diligence, enabling the user to focus on the most promising leads and the \"why now\" faster.\\n3.  **Dynamic SOP Co-pilot & Evolution Assistant:**\\n    *   **Workflow:** User's SOPs (e.g., `Athena - Revised Onboarding Touchpoints & Artifacts`, `Flight Preferences SOP`) are digitized and understood by an AI.\\n    *   **AI Action:** As tasks are performed (potentially by delegated assistants, whose communications or task management updates could be monitored with permission), the AI acts as a co-pilot:\\n        *   Provides context-aware snippets from the SOP.\\n        *   Flags deviations from the SOP and asks for justification or suggests corrective action.\\n        *   Logs common queries or pain points encountered during SOP execution.\\n        *   Periodically suggests updates or clarifications to the SOP based on observed inefficiencies or successful ad-hoc solutions.\\n    *   **Output:** Improved SOP adherence, reduced errors, continuous learning and refinement of operational processes, and less time spent on direct oversight.",

          "context_books": "The owner's reading habits indicate a profound interest in the underlying mechanisms of human cognition, decision-making, and behavior. This is evidenced by numerous titles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology, including less common academic or specialized works such as \"Cognitive Gadgets\" (Heyes) on the cultural evolution of thought, \"The Experience Machine\" (Clark) on consciousness and perception, \"Free Agents\" (Mitchell) and \"Determined\" (Sapolsky) on free will and its neurological basis, \"On Task\" (Badre) on executive function, and \"Playing with Reality\" (Clancy) on neuroscience and imagination. This intellectual curiosity extends to understanding psychological drivers like status (\"The Status Game\" - Storr), the nature of authoritarianism (\"The Authoritarians\" - Altemeyer), and specific cognitive profiles or traits (\"The Hypomanic Edge\" - Gartner, \"Driven to Distraction\" - Hallowell & Ratey), suggesting an appreciation for neurodiversity and optimizing cognitive function. A specific therapeutic modality, \"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy\" (Hayes), has also been explored, indicating an interest in psychological flexibility.\n\nThis deep intellectual exploration is paired with a pragmatic, systems-oriented approach to problem-solving.

Their interest in \"How Economics Can Save the World\" (Angner) and \"Everything is Predictable\" (Chivers) further suggests a preference for applying analytical frameworks and predictive insights to understand and navigate challenges.\n\nProfessionally, this translates into a strategic focus on growth, talent, and innovation. Books like \"Get Scalable\" (Deiss), \"Talent\" (Cowen & Gross), and \"The Power Law\" (Mallaby) point to an engagement with business scaling, talent management, and the dynamics of high-growth environments, particularly venture capital. A specific, practical interest in real estate investment strategy is noted with \"Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat\" (Greene).\n\nWhile heavily invested in productivity and performance, their approach is sophisticated, focusing on the cognitive underpinnings of deep work (\"Hyperfocus\" - Bailey, \"Peak Mind\" - Jha), sustainable practices (\"Slow Productivity\" - Newport, \"Rest\" - Pang), and developing internal capabilities (\"Self as Coach, Self as Leader\" - McLean). This interest appears to be about deeply understanding and optimizing the cognitive engine for sustained high performance rather than merely adopting superficial 'hacks'.\n\nThe owner also values effective communication and narrative, as shown by readings in storytelling techniques (\"Story Genius\" - Cron, \"Storyworthy\" - Dicks) and the creative process (\"The Creative Act\" - Rubin). All listed books were consumed as audiobooks, indicating a strong preference for this format for information intake.\n\n**How to Engage and Assist:**\nThe owner is likely receptive to in-depth, evidence-based discussions that explore underlying principles. They will appreciate analysis that goes beyond surface-level observations.\n*   **Intellectual Depth:** Present information with supporting evidence and clear reasoning. Engage with the 'why' behind strategies or observations.\n*   **Systemic Thinking:** Frame problems and solutions in terms of systems, root causes, and interconnectedness. Support proactive initiatives that address issues before they escalate.\n*   **Cognitive & Behavioral Awareness:** They may be particularly receptive to discussions framed around cognitive science, behavioral insights, or considerations for neurodiversity/cognitive optimization. Approaches that acknowledge psychological flexibility may resonate.\n*   **Strategic Support:** Assist with research, analysis, and strategy related to business growth, talent development, innovation ecosystems, and investment opportunities. Be prepared to discuss complex or niche topics within these domains.\n*   **Communication Style:** Employ clear, well-structured communication. Leveraging narrative or storytelling elements, when appropriate, could enhance engagement.\n*   **Information Delivery:** Recognize the strong preference for audio consumption. If providing summaries or reports, consider if an audio version or verbal briefing would be beneficial.\n*   **AI Assistant Interaction:** The AI should aim to provide summaries that extract core principles and mechanisms. It can offer proactive insights by identifying patterns or connecting new information to concepts from the owner's areas of interest (e.g., complexity, cognitive biases, upstream solutions). The AI should be prepared to elaborate on topics related to cognitive function, decision-making, and complex systems, and reference relevant concepts from their reading where applicable.\n\n<books>\n- Upstream by Dan Heath\n\t- 2025-04-12\n\t- audible\n\n- The Status Game by Will Storr\n\t- 2025-02-02\n\t- audible\n\n- Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick\n\t- 2025-01-03\n\t- audible\n\n- Slow Productivity by Cal Newport\n\t- 2024-12-23\n\t- audible\n\n- Get Better at Anything by Scott H.

The company's official website (About Us, Investor Relations, Press Releases, Blog, Product pages). \n2.  G2.com, Capterra.com, Sacra.ai, and Tegus.com.\n3.  The company's sitemap, e.g. \"\"https://spruceid.com/robots.txt\" and the relevant sitemap.xml listed in the robots.txt file (for SEO or content marketing strategy, partnerships, customers, etc).\n4.  The LinkedIn, Facebook, X, and TikTok ads libraries for the Spruce ID paid advertising strategy (if applicable).\n5.  The Spruce ID job listings for sales, marketing, growth, and related roles (often listing the strategy, tech stack, skills required, etc). \n6.  Reputable financial news outlets (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Forbes, TechCrunch, etc.). \n7.  Industry-specific publications and analyst reports. \n8.  Interviews with founders or key executives. \n9.  Case studies or success stories published by the company or its partners.  \n\nAvoid relying heavily on: \n1.  User-generated content with no clear editorial oversight (e.g., random forum/LinkedIn/X/Reddit posts, unverified reviews, Product Hunt). \n2.  Outdated information unless it's for historical context (always try to find the most current data for recent performance). \n3.  Pure speculation or unsourced opinions.  When searching, think broadly about how companies grow: product innovation, marketing strategies (digital, traditional, influencer, content), sales structures, funding, partnerships, and customer relations. Look for concrete examples, data where available, and strategic explanations.  \n\nStructure your raw findings clearly. Distinguish between facts, direct quotes, and summaries of information.

Customer Archetypes & Ideal Customer Profile (ICPs), Go-to-Market (GTM), & Customer Acquisition Strategy**         \n* For each sub-point (ICP/Target Audience, Acquisition Channels, Sales Model, Monetization, Geographic Focus), use a combination of descriptive paragraphs and bullet points for clarity.         \n* When discussing acquisition channels, provide brief evidence or examples found for each key channel used.  \n\n3. **Customer Experience & Retention**         \n* Use paragraphs to describe onboarding, support, retention strategies, and feedback mechanisms. Highlight any innovative or notable approaches.     \n\n4. **Competitive Landscape & Market Positioning**\n* List key competitors.         \n* Use paragraphs to explain differentiation and market perception.     \n\n5. **Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem**\n* Use bullet points to list key partners if many, or paragraphs if discussing broader ecosystem strategies. \n\n**Tone & Style:** \n* Objective, analytical, and professional. \n* Concise and to the point.

Keep it data-driven and analytical. \n* Never use phrases like \"unprecedented growth\" when you can make a metrics-based equivalent, like \"growing 200% year-over-year in annual recurring revenue.\"",

You MUST use **Spruce ID (URL: https://spruceid.com/)** and their known professional roles as strict filters.\n* **Verification Rule:** If you find *any* piece of information (professional OR personal) but **cannot confidently link it** to the *correct* Wayne Chang associated with Spruce ID, **YOU MUST DISCARD IT.** Do not guess.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION #2: ACTIVELY SEEK VERIFIED PERSONAL DETAILS.**\n* While maintaining accuracy, actively search *within verified sources* for publicly shared personal details. We want to understand the person, not just the professional.\n\n**Research Areas (Verify Each Point):**\n\n1.  **Establish & Verify Professional Context:**\n    * Confirm current and past roles at Spruce ID.\n    * Document educational background and previous key roles/companies. **(Use these as anchors).**\n    * Identify expertise and key professional achievements.\n    * Detail their role and impact specifically at Spruce ID.\n\n2.  **Identify Confirmed Public Presence & Sources:**\n    * Locate their **verified** LinkedIn profile.\n    * Find interviews (print, audio, video), podcasts, and articles where they are **explicitly identified with Spruce ID or their known, verified career path.** **(These are your primary sources for personal details).**\n    * Find any **confirmed** personal blogs or writings linked from verified professional sources.\n\n3.  **Extract Personal Insights (From Verified Sources ONLY):**\n    * **Once a source is confirmed as being about the *correct* person**, carefully review it for:\n        * **Directly Stated Hobbies & Activities:** Look for phrases like \"I enjoy...\", \"In my spare time...\", etc. (e.g., sports, arts, music, reading, coding, travel).\n        * **Explicit Preferences:** Note any mentioned favorites (books, authors, music, movies, food, etc.).\n        * **Shared Personal Routines/Habits:** Any specific daily routines or personal habits discussed.\n        * **Articulated Motivations/Philosophies:** Personal values, life views, or sources of motivation they've shared.\n        * **Relevant Personal Anecdotes:** Stories shared *by them* that offer context.\n    * **Prioritize direct quotes or first-person accounts** for personal information.\n    * **If a source seems personal but doesn't clearly identify the person as *our* target, DO NOT use it.**\n\n4.  **Map Network & Influence (Verified):**\n    * Identify key professional connections or board memberships.\n\n**Cite ALL information meticulously, indicating the source and your confidence (implicitly through selection, explicitly if needed).**",

([SpruceID](https://spruceid.com/))\n\n### Growth Signals\n*   **Credentials issued:** 1.6 million+ (overall) (SpruceID Homepage)\n*   **Time to production:** 6 months (average) (SpruceID Homepage)\n*   **App reviews:** 60 000+ reviews with 4.8 ★ rating (SpruceID Homepage)\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Competitors\n*   Cheqd\n*   MATTR\n*   Indicio\n*   Spherity\n*   Trinsic\n*   Privado ID\n*   Polygon ID\n\n### Differentiators\n*   AI-resistant credentials with cryptographic protections that prevent generative AI–driven forgery\n*   On-device, privacy-first verification that discloses only minimal data and avoids server-side tracking\n*   Built on open W3C Verifiable Credentials standards for interoperability across ecosystems\n*   Rapid deployment enabling credential issuance to production in as little as six months\n*   Pioneering mobile driver’s licenses in partnership with government agencies\n\n### Market Perception\nSpruce ID is widely recognized by media and analysts as a leading provider of privacy-preserving digital identity solutions, praised for its open-source ethos, compliance with emerging standards, and real-world implementations such as state-level mobile driver’s licenses; users commend its developer-friendly tools and strong support infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Customer Experience\n\n### Onboarding Journey\nSpruceID streamlines the path from initial sign-up to production-ready credential issuance through its Credible platform and SpruceKit open-source components. Organizations register for an API key via the SpruceID dashboard, configure credential schemas using guided workflows, and integrate SpruceKit libraries into their applications for issuance to native or third-party wallets. Most customers achieve time-to-production in under six months, often within weeks, as evidenced by reported six-month average deployment times for mobile driver’s licenses in California and other vertical proofs of concept ([spruceid.com](https://spruceid.com/), [spruceid.com/products/issuing-digital-ids](https://spruceid.com/products/issuing-digital-ids)).\n\n### Support & Success\nSpruceID provides dedicated customer support through its Technical Success team, which includes Technical Success Managers who guide clients through integration, customization, and scaling of digital credential solutions. Customers also have access to a comprehensive Knowledge Base covering standards, technology, and implementation considerations, as well as developer-centric Quickstart guides and example repositories for SpruceKit and SSX on GitHub ([blog.spruceid.com](https://blog.spruceid.com/meet-the-spruceid-team-bryce-einck), [spruceid.com/learn](https://spruceid.com/learn)).\n\n### Retention Levers\n*   Continuous feature updates and modular open-source SpruceKit libraries allow customers to extend functionality and remain aligned with evolving identity standards.\n*   Industry-focused solutions and customer highlights (e.g., California DMV mDL) demonstrate tailored vertical expertise that deepens long-term partnerships.\n*   Built-in privacy-first and AI-resistant security features ensure compliance and risk mitigation, reinforcing stickiness with security-conscious enterprise customers.\n*   Strong community engagement through developer repos, blog updates, and participation in standards bodies fosters loyalty and peer support.\n\n### Feedback Loop\nSpruceID maintains an active feedback loop by soliciting input via App Store and developer platform reviews, GitHub issues, and direct Technical Success consultations. User insights from production deployments—such as requests for new assurance workflows, integration support, or wallet interoperability—drive roadmap prioritization and enhancements to the Credible platform and SpruceKit offerings, ensuring the product evolves in line with customer needs ([spruceid.com](https://spruceid.com/), [github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid)).\n\n---\n\n## Go-to-Market & Positioning\n\n### Target Segments\nSpruceID targets B2B customers across regulated industries—primarily government agencies (e.g., DMVs), financial services firms, healthcare providers, education institutions, online marketplaces, and Web3 platforms—focused on identity, risk, and compliance teams seeking AI-resistant, privacy-protecting digital credential solutions.\n\n### Acquisition Channels\n*   Content marketing and SEO via whitepapers (e.g., Verifiable Digital Credentials: 2024 in Review) and knowledge-base articles to educate prospects on digital identity standards.\n*   Partnerships and strategic alliances with government agencies (e.g., California DMV), standards bodies (W3C, DIF), and open-source communities to co-develop and promote interoperable solutions.\n*   Community and open-source engagement through GitHub, developer tools (DIDKit, SpruceKit), and presence at industry events (European Identity & Cloud Conference).\n*   Direct sales outreach and high-touch enterprise engagements for large public sector and financial services deals.\n*   Product-led growth elements by offering open-source libraries and reference wallets (Credible wallet) enabling developers to trial key functionality.\n*   Webinars, thought leadership panels, and conferences to build brand awareness among identity and security professionals.\n\n### Sales Process\nSpruceID employs a hybrid sales process: developers and small teams can self-serve via open-source libraries and documentation to prototype, while larger enterprise and public sector customers engage via a consultative, high-touch sales team to scope, integrate, and deploy Credible platform solutions.\n\n### Monetization & Pricing\n\n#### Revenue Model\nSubscription-based SaaS with tiered enterprise licensing, including usage-based billing per credential issued or verified, plus professional services fees for integration, customization, and support.\n\n#### Pricing Tiers\nSpruceID offers usage-based tiers: a free entry tier for developers (open-source SDKs, limited test credentials), a professional tier (fixed monthly fee with a defined number of credentials issued/verifications), and an enterprise tier (custom pricing, SLA, volume discounts, and dedicated support).\n\n### Geography\nHeadquartered in New York, SpruceID serves North American and European markets, with expansion efforts evidenced by participation at EIC in Berlin. It targets global regulated markets, focusing initially on the U.S. public sector (state DMVs) and financial centers, with plans to grow in EMEA through partnerships and compliance with regional identity standards.\n\n---\n\n## Partnerships & Ecosystem\n\n### Tech Integrations\n*   React Native\n*   Flutter\n*   Kotlin\n*   Swift\n*   MetaMask\n*   Apple Wallet\n*   Google Wallet\n\n### Alliances & Channels\nSpruce ID has formed strategic alliances with government and industry entities, partnering with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST on mobile driver’s license reference implementations, collaborating with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles on its pioneering mobile driver’s license program, and working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program to develop privacy-preserving digital credential wallets and verifiers.\n\n### Industry Engagement\nSpruce ID contributes and maintains key open-source libraries—including ISO mDL, DIDKit, and SSI—supports and participates as a member in W3C standards bodies for Verifiable Credential Data Model and Decentralized Identifiers, hosts and contributes to interoperability test events, and regularly publishes research and case studies on emerging digital identity protocols and industry events.\n```"

([SpruceID](https://spruceid.com/products))\n*   **Value Proposition:** SpruceID’s solutions provide built-in security against AI-generated forgeries, privacy-preserving offline verifications, selective disclosure of data, and full lifecycle observability. ([SpruceID](https://spruceid.com/))\n\n### Growth Signals\n*   **Credentials issued:** 1.6 million+ (overall) (SpruceID Homepage)\n*   **Time to production:** 6 months (average) (SpruceID Homepage)\n*   **App reviews:** 60 000+ reviews with 4.8 ★ rating (SpruceID Homepage)\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Competitors\n*   Cheqd\n*   MATTR\n*   Indicio\n*   Spherity\n*   Trinsic\n*   Privado ID\n*   Polygon ID\n\n### Differentiators\n*   AI-resistant credentials with cryptographic protections that prevent generative AI–driven forgery\n*   On-device, privacy-first verification that discloses only minimal data and avoids server-side tracking\n*   Built on open W3C Verifiable Credentials standards for interoperability across ecosystems\n*   Rapid deployment enabling credential issuance to production in as little as six months\n*   Pioneering mobile driver’s licenses in partnership with government agencies\n\n### Market Perception\nSpruce ID is widely recognized by media and analysts as a leading provider of privacy-preserving digital identity solutions, praised for its open-source ethos, compliance with emerging standards, and real-world implementations such as state-level mobile driver’s licenses; users commend its developer-friendly tools and strong support infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Customer Experience\n\n### Onboarding Journey\nSpruceID streamlines the path from initial sign-up to production-ready credential issuance through its Credible platform and SpruceKit open-source components. Organizations register for an API key via the SpruceID dashboard, configure credential schemas using guided workflows, and integrate SpruceKit libraries into their applications for issuance to native or third-party wallets. Most customers achieve time-to-production in under six months, often within weeks, as evidenced by reported six-month average deployment times for mobile driver’s licenses in California and other vertical proofs of concept ([spruceid.com](https://spruceid.com/), [spruceid.com/products/issuing-digital-ids](https://spruceid.com/products/issuing-digital-ids)).\n\n### Support & Success\nSpruceID provides dedicated customer support through its Technical Success team, which includes Technical Success Managers who guide clients through integration, customization, and scaling of digital credential solutions. Customers also have access to a comprehensive Knowledge Base covering standards, technology, and implementation considerations, as well as developer-centric Quickstart guides and example repositories for SpruceKit and SSX on GitHub ([blog.spruceid.com](https://blog.spruceid.com/meet-the-spruceid-team-bryce-einck), [spruceid.com/learn](https://spruceid.com/learn)).\n\n### Retention Levers\n*   Continuous feature updates and modular open-source SpruceKit libraries allow customers to extend functionality and remain aligned with evolving identity standards.\n*   Industry-focused solutions and customer highlights (e.g., California DMV mDL) demonstrate tailored vertical expertise that deepens long-term partnerships.\n*   Built-in privacy-first and AI-resistant security features ensure compliance and risk mitigation, reinforcing stickiness with security-conscious enterprise customers.\n*   Strong community engagement through developer repos, blog updates, and participation in standards bodies fosters loyalty and peer support.\n\n### Feedback Loop\nSpruceID maintains an active feedback loop by soliciting input via App Store and developer platform reviews, GitHub issues, and direct Technical Success consultations. User insights from production deployments—such as requests for new assurance workflows, integration support, or wallet interoperability—drive roadmap prioritization and enhancements to the Credible platform and SpruceKit offerings, ensuring the product evolves in line with customer needs ([spruceid.com](https://spruceid.com/), [github.com/spruceid](https://github.com/spruceid)).\n\n---\n\n## Go-to-Market & Positioning\n\n### Target Segments\nSpruceID targets B2B customers across regulated industries—primarily government agencies (e.g., DMVs), financial services firms, healthcare providers, education institutions, online marketplaces, and Web3 platforms—focused on identity, risk, and compliance teams seeking AI-resistant, privacy-protecting digital credential solutions.\n\n### Acquisition Channels\n*   Content marketing and SEO via whitepapers (e.g., Verifiable Digital Credentials: 2024 in Review) and knowledge-base articles to educate prospects on digital identity standards.\n*   Partnerships and strategic alliances with government agencies (e.g., California DMV), standards bodies (W3C, DIF), and open-source communities to co-develop and promote interoperable solutions.\n*   Community and open-source engagement through GitHub, developer tools (DIDKit, SpruceKit), and presence at industry events (European Identity & Cloud Conference).\n*   Direct sales outreach and high-touch enterprise engagements for large public sector and financial services deals.\n*   Product-led growth elements by offering open-source libraries and reference wallets (Credible wallet) enabling developers to trial key functionality.\n*   Webinars, thought leadership panels, and conferences to build brand awareness among identity and security professionals.\n\n### Sales Process\nSpruceID employs a hybrid sales process: developers and small teams can self-serve via open-source libraries and documentation to prototype, while larger enterprise and public sector customers engage via a consultative, high-touch sales team to scope, integrate, and deploy Credible platform solutions.\n\n### Monetization & Pricing\n\n#### Revenue Model\nSubscription-based SaaS with tiered enterprise licensing, including usage-based billing per credential issued or verified, plus professional services fees for integration, customization, and support.\n\n#### Pricing Tiers\nSpruceID offers usage-based tiers: a free entry tier for developers (open-source SDKs, limited test credentials), a professional tier (fixed monthly fee with a defined number of credentials issued/verifications), and an enterprise tier (custom pricing, SLA, volume discounts, and dedicated support).\n\n### Geography\nHeadquartered in New York, SpruceID serves North American and European markets, with expansion efforts evidenced by participation at EIC in Berlin. It targets global regulated markets, focusing initially on the U.S. public sector (state DMVs) and financial centers, with plans to grow in EMEA through partnerships and compliance with regional identity standards.\n\n---\n\n## Partnerships & Ecosystem\n\n### Tech Integrations\n*   React Native\n*   Flutter\n*   Kotlin\n*   Swift\n*   MetaMask\n*   Apple Wallet\n*   Google Wallet\n\n### Alliances & Channels\nSpruce ID has formed strategic alliances with government and industry entities, partnering with the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST on mobile driver’s license reference implementations, collaborating with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles on its pioneering mobile driver’s license program, and working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program to develop privacy-preserving digital credential wallets and verifiers.\n\n### Industry Engagement\nSpruce ID contributes and maintains key open-source libraries—including ISO mDL, DIDKit, and SSI—supports and participates as a member in W3C standards bodies for Verifiable Credential Data Model and Decentralized Identifiers, hosts and contributes to interoperability test events, and regularly publishes research and case studies on emerging digital identity protocols and industry events.\n```",

Your mission is to create an **accurate and balanced** profile of **Wayne Chang**, specifically focusing on their connection to **Spruce ID**. This profile must include **both verified professional achievements and any available, reliably sourced personal insights** (hobbies, preferences, etc.).\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION #1: ACCURACY IS PARAMOUNT - AVOID MISIDENTIFICATION.**\n* Many people share the same name. You MUST use **Spruce ID (URL: https://spruceid.com/)** and their known professional roles as strict filters.\n* **Verification Rule:** If you find *any* piece of information (professional OR personal) but **cannot confidently link it** to the *correct* Wayne Chang associated with Spruce ID, **YOU MUST DISCARD IT.** Do not guess.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION #2: ACTIVELY SEEK VERIFIED PERSONAL DETAILS.**\n* While maintaining accuracy, actively search *within verified sources* for publicly shared personal details. We want to understand the person, not just the professional.\n\n**Research Areas (Verify Each Point):**\n\n1.  **Establish & Verify Professional Context:**\n    * Confirm current and past roles at Spruce ID.\n    * Document educational background and previous key roles/companies. **(Use these as anchors).**\n    * Identify expertise and key professional achievements.\n    * Detail their role and impact specifically at Spruce ID.\n\n2.  **Identify Confirmed Public Presence & Sources:**\n    * Locate their **verified** LinkedIn profile.\n    * Find interviews (print, audio, video), podcasts, and articles where they are **explicitly identified with Spruce ID or their known, verified career path.** **(These are your primary sources for personal details).**\n    * Find any **confirmed** personal blogs or writings linked from verified professional sources.\n\n3.  **Extract Personal Insights (From Verified Sources ONLY):**\n    * **Once a source is confirmed as being about the *correct* person**, carefully review it for:\n        * **Directly Stated Hobbies & Activities:** Look for phrases like \"I enjoy...\", \"In my spare time...\", etc. (e.g., sports, arts, music, reading, coding, travel).\n        * **Explicit Preferences:** Note any mentioned favorites (books, authors, music, movies, food, etc.).\n        * **Shared Personal Routines/Habits:** Any specific daily routines or personal habits discussed.\n        * **Articulated Motivations/Philosophies:** Personal values, life views, or sources of motivation they've shared.\n        * **Relevant Personal Anecdotes:** Stories shared *by them* that offer context.\n    * **Prioritize direct quotes or first-person accounts** for personal information.\n    * **If a source seems personal but doesn't clearly identify the person as *our* target, DO NOT use it.**\n\n4.  **Map Network & Influence (Verified):**\n    * Identify key professional connections or board memberships.\n\n**Cite ALL information meticulously, indicating the source and your confidence (implicitly through selection, explicitly if needed).**",
